      <p>If you are reading this, you have found your way to the fall
    2017 STAC32 home page. Welcome!
	<h2>News:</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>2017-12-15 12:30: course grades are submitted. They have to be
	    approved (probably today) and will then be released to
	    you. With that, I wish you a Merry Christmas (or, if you
	    don't celebrate that, a happy break from your studies), and
	    look forward to seeing some of you again in January for
	    STAD29. 
	  <li>2017-12-15 12:00: I am almost ready to submit the
	    grades. Some points (so that you don't have to ask):
	    
	    <ul>
	      <li>I used two marking schemes: scheme 1 is the one in
		the course outline, and scheme 2 replaces the midterm
		mark with the final exam one. You automatically get
		whichever marking scheme is better for you. It was about
		50-50. I did this because, in my opinion, if you can
		demonstrate your learning on the final exam, that's what
		really counts, and if you can do that, you deserve a
		grade boost. (The people who missed the midterm
		automatically get scheme 2.)
	      <li>If you got less than 42/104 on the final exam, you
		cannot pass the course. In that case, your grade will
		be the smaller of your calculated grade and 45. I have
		already relaxed the final exam requirement from the
		course outline. Do not ask me to relax it any more.
	      <li>Grade rounding: I do not give grades one mark below
		a grade-point boundary, such as 79. The procedure: if
		you actually got 79.5 or more that would round up, you
		get 80; if not (for example 79.3), it's rounded down to
		78. The principle is that if you want 80, you have to
		earn it, and 79.3 is not earning it. The same applies
		to other grade-point boundaries such as 66: 66.5+ is
		rounded up to 67, less than that is rounded down to
		65. 
	    </ul>
	  <li>2017-12-14 21:45: official course grades tomorrow. I
	  want to be more awake than I am now in order to calculate
	  them correctly (or, to be more precise, to instruct R to
	  calculate them correctly).
	  <li>2017-12-14 21:35: I'm going to post the final exam marks
	  on Blackboard in a moment. Before you go looking, read this
	  first: if you are unhappy with your final exam mark, or the
	  course grade to which it leads (which you will be in a
	  position to calculate), DO NOT contact me. I am not allowed
	  to engage in any discussion about it. Wait for the course
	  grades to come out, and then speak to the Registrar's
	  office, who will be able to advise you of your
	    rights. Course grades are based <em>only</em> on the work
	  you have done in this course. If you need a certain grade in
	    this course for whatever personal reason, it is <em>up to
	  you</em> to do the work required to get it.
	  <li>2017-12-14 21:30: I said that you have to pass the final
	  exam to pass the course. I'm going to relax that:
	  if you got 42 or more out of 104 (that's about 40% or more),
	  you pass the course <em>if</em> your course
	  grade, as calculated, comes out to 50 or more. This allows
	  about 10 more people a shot at passing the course.  (There
	  were some final exam marks less than 42; I do not think that
	  the people who wrote those exams have demonstrated enough
	  learning in this course to be allowed to pass it, based on
	  what I saw while marking their exams.)
	  <li>2017-12-14 21:30: final exam stats (out of 104 marks):
	  median 74, Q1 60, Q3 84. High score 99. This was an exam of
	  average difficulty overall: some hard parts, but some very
	  easy ones as well. There were some really good
	  performances on this exam.
	  <li>2017-12-14 18:15: final exam marks are in Blackboard,
	  but not released to you (yet). I want to look them over
	  tonight. When I am happy with them, I will let you see what
	    you got, so that you know where you stand. Warning
	  now: <em>I am not allowed to discuss or negotiate any
	  aspect of the grades.</em> I am sharing the final exam marks
	  as a courtesy to you. Don't abuse this courtesy.
	  <li>2017-12-14 17:30: added up, now sorting. Then: enter
	  final exam marks, look them over, then compute grades.
	  <li>2017-12-14 13:30: eating lunch (fresh bread!) On the
	  agenda for this afternoon: adding up (the marks on the front
	  page), sorting and recording. Then I have to calculate the
	  course grades.
	  <li>2017-12-14 12:30: marking done! I have to go one more
	  time through the pile to add up and record the last
	  page. Imagine, if you will, a rather unsteady pile of exams
	  all open to the last page. (By the way, my bread is done,
	  but I'm not having any until I finish this job.)
	  <li>2017-12-14 11:55: 10(c) done. Marking code goes fast
	  (often). I knew I put this question last for a reason!
	  <li>2017-12-14 11:25: 10(b) done. Fast work. I went back
	    over (a) also and gave some people an extra mark, since I
	    felt I had been too mean.  Two parts left. I am baking
	    bread, hopefully to celebrate the end of marking.
	    
	  <li>2017-12-14 10:45: 10(a) done. Three parts to go.
	  <li>2017-12-13 23:15: page 11 is marked. 91.67% done
	  marking. It looks as if I have about 4 hours of marking
	  left, plus 2 pages to add up, before I get to the totalling,
	  sorting and recording.
	  <li>2017-12-13 22:15: 9(b) done. I <em>might</em> have it in
	  me to tackle part (c) and finish the page tonight.
	  <li>2017-12-13 21:00: question 9(a) on page 11 done. One
	  more time through the pile tonight, I think, unless 9(b) is
	  very quick.
	  <li>2017-12-13 18:15: page 10 added up. Dinner, then to see
	  if I can make a (figurative) dent in page 11 tonight.
	  <li>2017-12-13 17:00: page 10 done. 83.33% done. With the
	  marking part, anyway.
	  <li>2017-12-13 15:00: one part into page 10 (question
	    8(a)). Need tea.
	    
	  <li>2017-12-13 13:00: page 9 (question 7)
	  done. Lunchtime. If you are curious about what would happen
	  if we do a square root transformation in question 7, take a
	    look at <a href="final.pdf">my solutions</a>, where I do it.
	  <li>2017-12-13 11:30: 7(d) (second part of page 9) done.
	  <li>2017-12-12 22:30: busy evening on other things, but the
	  first part of page 9 (question 7(c)) is done. Hoping for a
	  productive day tomorrow. Marking supported by Beethoven's
	  Symphony no. 1 (partly to get "Rocking All Over The World"
	    out of my head: see <a href="final.pdf">my solutions</a>
	  for why that was in there). 
	  <li>2017-12-12 16:35: page 8 added up. Two-thirds
	  done. Might be grades on Thursday, but don't count your
	  chickens yet.
	  <li>2017-12-12 16:00: a slow afternoon, but page 8 is done
	  now, needing only adding up.
	  <li>2017-12-12 12:45: third of four parts done (that's
	  question 7(a) on page 8).
	  <li>2017-12-12 11:30: second of four parts done. (That
	  completes question 6, if you're keeping track.)
	  <li>2017-12-12 10:15: first of four parts on page 8 done.
	  <li>2017-12-11 23:00: page 7 is done.
	  <li>2017-12-11 21:30: third part done, much faster. I want
	  to see if I can take care of the fourth part and the adding
	  up of page 7 tonight. 
	  <li>2017-12-11 21:00: the second part is now done, but it
	  took me a lot longer than expected because there were a
	  bunch of possible correct answers, some of which I had to
	  check because I wasn't sure whether they would work. As
	    ever, <a href="final.pdf">my solutions</a> contain the
	  gory details.
	  <li>2017-12-11 19:20: first of four parts on page 7
	  done. I'm hoping this will be a quick page.
	  <li>2017-12-11 17:30: page 6 added up. Halfway. And dinner
	  time. 
	  <li>2017-12-11 16:30: page 6 done. When I have added it up,
	  I'll be halfway done marking. (Always a pleasing thought.)
	  <li>2017-12-11 15:45: part (c) done. One more part to go on
	  this page. (In between the last note and this one, we had a
	  power outage here, and I had the exams right up against the
	  window so that I had enough light to see them! Power is back
	  now.)
	  <li>2017-12-11 14:15: parts (a) and (b) done on page 6. Part
	  (c) will require thinking. We are apparently two and a half
	  hours away from snow. If I get snowed in, I have enough to
	  keep me occupied.
	  <li>2017-12-11 11:15: I have the Accessability exams and
	  have caught them up to the other pile. Back, shortly, to all
	  the exams combined.
	  <li>2017-12-10 21:45: page 5 added up. That's it for
	  tonight. I think I have some easy marking to start with
	  tomorrow. 
	  <li>2017-12-10 21:00: page 5 done, but not added up yet.
	  <li>2017-12-10 19:45: third of those four parts done, with a
	  break for dinner in between. 
	  <li>2017-12-10 17:15: second of those four parts done.
	  <li>2017-12-10 16:30: first of the four parts on page 5
	  done. (I decided to go for a walk before it started snowing.)
	  <li>2017-12-10 13:45: page 4 added up. There are 2 people
	  who still have a perfect score. Lunch break.
	  <li>2017-12-10 13:00: page 4 done. The second part on page 4
	  did indeed require a fair bit of thinking on my part.
	  <li>2017-12-09 22:50: first of the two parts on page 4
	  done. That's my limit for tonight (the second part requires
	  more thinking than I have in me now).
	  <li>2017-12-09 21:20: page 3 added up. This takes a long
	  time with so many students. Planning one more assault on the
	  pile tonight, but I need a break first. There are about 6
	  people with a perfect score through 3 pages.
	  <li>2017-12-09 20:30: page 3 done (but yet to be added up).
	  <li>2017-12-09 19:30: dinner, and also part 2(c), done. 
	  <li>2017-12-09 18:30: dinner time. Halfway through 2(c). (If
	    you read <a href="final.pdf">my solutions</a>, you'll see
	    how I can stop halfway through 2(c) and still be
	    consistent.) 
	  <li>2017-12-09 17:30: 2(b) done, at the speed of light.
	  <li>2017-12-09 16:30: 2(a) done, at the top of page 3.
	  <li>2017-12-08 21:30: page 2 done. A mere 10 pages to
	  go. Megan went to sleep early, but she just woke up (after
	    I'd finished page 2), wanting dinner. The
	  latest <a href="final.pdf">solutions</a> with marking notes.
	  <li>2017-12-08 13:00: 1(f)(i) done (if you see what I
	  mean). I wanted to go all the way through the pile, for
	  consistency, so I have checked to see whether you drew the
	  appropriate conclusion from Figure 2. The rest I'll get to
	  later. 
	  <li>2017-12-08 11:30: 1(e) done. I may take the complicated
	  1(f) in stages, plus I have to go meet Megan off the school
	  bus after lunch.
	  <li>2017-12-07 23:00: finished 1(d) (at the top of page
	  2). That'll be it for tonight.
	  <li>2017-12-07 21:00: I have to say something here. I have
	  received several requests from students asking me to "let
	  them pass the course" (or similar words). I need to be very
	    clear about this: <b>do not ever do this, in any
	  course</b>. I also need to be very clear about what such
	  students are asking for: special treatment available to them
	    alone, and not to all students. <b>No professor will ever
	  give you this kind of special treatment.</b> Your personal
	    circumstances as a student are <em>irrelevant</em> to the
	    grade you get for work in a course; the <em>only</em> thing that
	  affects your grade in a course is the work that you do in
	    that course, and the <em>only</em> way to pass a course is
	  to do work of the required standard. If you don't, you don't
	  pass the course. Appeals to the professor don't do anything
	  to change this, and may even have the opposite effect to the
	  one you are looking for. 
	  <li>2017-12-07 20:55: 1(c) done, and next I add up page 1.
	  <li>2017-12-07 18:45: 1(b) is done. Dinner break. I'm going
	    to upload
	    my <a href="final.pdf">solutions-with-grading-notes</a> as
	    I go along, so if you want to, you can check to see what I
	    was expecting. 
	  <li>2017-12-07 17:30: and so it begins. 1(a) is done. I may
	  have a long evening ahead of me. 
	  <li>2017-12-06 17:00: I think I'm done marking
	  projects. Check Blackboard for your grade. All members of a
	  group got the same grade. The most likely error I have made
	  is in recording the grade for other members of a group apart
	  from the person who handed the project in. If your project
	  grade is missing or is inconsistent with the other members
	  of your group, send me email with your name and student
	    number <em>and</em> the name (and student  number if you
	  have it) of the person who handed in the project, so that I
	  can check. You don't need to rush to do this now, but do it
	  before 11:59pm on Monday December 11, so that your course
	    grade is computed properly.

	    <p> The project grades are not open to negotiation. I am
	    happy that they are consistent with each other and with my
	    norms for this course. As I said, this is a "summative
	    assessment", the purpose of which is to give you a grade,
	    not feedback. Under other circumstances (like a later
	    final exam), I would be happy to discuss how you could
	    have done better, but there isn't time for that this
	    semester. 
	  <li>2017-12-06 13:30: marking projects. 25 of them to go. If
	  you handed yours in before about 10:30pm. it should be
	  marked now.
	  <li>2017-12-05 22:20: I think I have 35 projects left to
	  grade, which I intend to spend tomorrow doing. If you handed
	  your project in before 9:00pm on Monday, it should be
	  marked; if not, not yet.
	  <li>2017-12-04 22:00: stopping for tonight. If
	  I got it before 8 tonight, it's marked. If not, it'll have
	  to wait until tomorrow or (at the latest, I hope) Wednesday.
	  <li>2017-12-04 20:00: working through the projects received
	  since this afternoon. The project is what's known in the
	  jargon as a "summative assessment" (that is, I read it
	  through and give you a grade) rather than a "formative
	  assessment" (where I would give you feedback, like the
	  assignments). The comments on these are therefore
	  minimal. When you see your project, you should see four
	  numbers, the sum of which is your score:
	    <ul>
	      <li>a mark out of 10 for the introduction
	      <li>a mark out of 25 for the analysis
	      <li>a mark out of 10 for the conclusion (and discussion, if you have one)
	      <li>a mark out of 5 for the writing, shown below your conclusion, but above the appendix if you have one.
	    </ul>
	    No-one will get 50 out of 50, because there are always
	    things that can be improved. As a guideline, a mark around
	    70% (on each item) is what I would expect to see in this
	    course, and a mark of 80% or above struck me as being good
	    work, where your comments or process was especially
	    clear. To get 90%, you need to really impress me.
	    If you got below 70%, I noted things clearly
	    missing, or mistakes made, or your process was hard to
	    follow. By marking the projects in as short a timeframe as
	    I can, I am grading them as consistently as I can manage.

	    <p> I have 5 working days after our final exam to get all
	    the projects marked, all the exams marked, and the grades
	      in. (I also have two STAD94 projects due in tonight that
	      have to be graded within the same 5 working days.)
	      It will be enormously difficult to get this done in
	    time. I am not therefore available to discuss the grading
	      of the project.

	    <p> What I would like to do, but have so far not been able
	    to manage, is to make the project at least partly a
	    formative assessment, for example  by having you hand in a
	    draft and I return it with comments which you can then
	    take into account for the final version. The problem in
	    this course is that the projects are mostly regressions,
	    which we don't tackle until late on in the course because
	    we have other things to get through first. So, in this
	      course, the project is a summative
	    assessment. See <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/basics/formative-summative.html">here</a>
	    for a good discussion of what these things are, with
	    examples of each.
	  <li>2017-12-04 12:30: I have graded all the projects I have
	  received so far. This means that if your project reaches me
	  before late this afternoon, it has a good chance of being
	  marked today. I won't have much marking time tomorrow (since
	  I'll be having office hours), so if it doesn't get done
	  today, it'll likely be Wednesday (or later, depending how
	  many come in at the last minute).
	  <li>2017-12-04 10:00: last chance for course
	  evaluations. These close on Wednesday at 23:59. Thanks to
	  the 39 people who have completed them so far.
	  <li>2017-12-03 18:15: I have graded the projects that were
	  handed in before 2:00pm today. I see there are about 6 more
	  since then which I intend to get to tonight. I will release
	  the marks for those on Tuesday morning, after everyone has
	  handed their projects in.
	  <li>2017-11-30 10:30: pre-exam office hours
	  on <em>Tuesday</em>, 11:00-3:00, in my office. I am not
	  available other days because I am marking projects or have
	  other responsibilities. Sorry. I will release the marks for
	  projects I have marked on Tuesday morning; the earlier you
	  hand it in, the better your chances of having your mark
	  before the final exam.
	  <li>2017-11-30 10:30: Last lecture today. I will be doing
	  Section 15 "Miscellaneous Stuff" today, but I will be
	  skipping parts. Come to the lecture or watch the video to
	  find out which bits to skip. I have to leave after lecture.
	  <li>2017-11-28 12:45: there *are* tutorials tomorrow in the
	  usual place. Use this opportunity to ask final questions
	  about the project (bearing in mind that part of the reason
	  for the project is for *you* to make decisions about how it
	  should look), and about the old exams or extra
	  non-assignments. I will have pre-exam office hours on
	  Tuesday next week, but am likely not available Friday or
	  Monday, since I will be marking the projects that were
	  handed in early.
	  <li>2017-11-27 23:30: I added a question on writing
	    functions to <a href="assignments/a87.pdf">"Assignment
	    8.7"</a>, on this week's material.
	  <li>2017-11-27 12:30: I think I'm done with the final
	  exam. 10 questions on 12 pages (with lots of room for
	  writing), for a total of what came out to be 104 marks.
	  <li>2017-11-27 11:30: course evaluations are open until
	  December 6. Why is it important for you to complete a course
	    evaluation?
	    <ul>
	      <li>If you liked the course, you help <em>me</em> by saying what
		you liked and why. (Everyone in the department has
		their performance reviewed at the end of the year, and
		student evaluations go a long way towards saying what
		that review looks like.)
	      <li>If there was something you disliked, you
	      help <em>future students</em> by saying what
	      you disliked and how you think it could be improved.
	      <li>You also help <em>yourself</em>: you help your own
		thinking process by getting accustomed to thinking
		critically about what you are learning and how you are
		learning it.
	    </ul>

	    Thank you to those who have completed course evaluations
	    already. (I don't see the evaluations until next semester,
	    so they cannot affect the grade you get.)
	  <li>2017-11-26 12:30: The room allocation for the final exam
	  (Thursday December 7 at 9:00am) is: last names A-L in SW
	  309, last names M-Z in SW 319. There are not many spare
	  seats, so make sure you go to the correct room.
	  <li>2017-11-24 13:00: the 2015 final exam has been
	    2017-ized. Find it on the <a href="oldexams/">old exams page</a>.
	    
	  <li>2017-11-23 17:35: the revised <a href="oldexams/final16.pdf">2016 final exam</a> and
	    <a href="oldexams/final16s.pdf">solutions</a> is up. I had
	  to add to some of the questions to make it reasonable to do
	  for you, based on what we have done this year. Let me know
	  if anything is missing or confusing. I have a long GO bus
	  ride tomorrow, during which I might be able to tackle the
	  2015 exam.
	  <li>2017-11-23 17:05: I am 2017-ifying last year's final
	  exam, which is taking longer than I expected, partly because
	  I realized that my version of R was getting old, and in
	  updating it, I had to reinstall all my packages.
	  <li>2017-11-23 13:05: I forgot to mention in class today
	  that I am currently looking over old final exams and adding
	  a "2017" piece to the solutions that are there now. I will
	  let you know when the new versions are up.
	  <li>2017-11-22 21:30: looking ahead to next week, which is
	  the last week of classes: I would like to talk about
	  functions in R (Tuesday) and some additional graphing stuff
	  (Thursday). I will make an "Assignment 8.7" on this from any
	  questions I have lying around about these. (This is not to
	  overburden you with work, but to help you prepare for the
	  final exam.)
	    <P> Looking further ahead, I will have pre-exam office
	    hours one of the days before the exam (I'm thinking
	    Tuesday), but my time will be short because I will be
	    marking projects. On that note, if you hand your project
	    in early, I may be able to start marking it early, which
	    improves my chances of getting your mark to you before the
	    final exam. With the timing how it is, however, don't
	    expect anything more than a mark from me on your project;
	    there won't be time for feedback or discussion.
	      <p> I'm planning to have tutorials next Wednesday, which
	      will give you a chance for final questions about your
	      project (best addressed to me) or questions about the course
	      material (ask me or the TA). 
	  <li>2017-11-22 21:30: there is now
	  an <a href="assignments/a86.pdf">"Assignment 8.6"</a> of
	  practice questions on this week's stuff. The first question
	  there is yet another take on the crickets data. 
	  <li>2017-11-21 16:30: I have a draft copy of the final exam
	  (which will undergo some editing before I send it for
	  printing). It has 10 questions on 12 pages worth a total of
	  108 marks, as it stands now. The midterm totalled 80 marks,
	  which means that the final is about 30% longer than the
	  midterm, but you have 50% more time to do it. It's 12 pages
	  rather than 10 or 11 because I have spaced things out to
	  give you more room to write. (Later: I tinkered some more,
	  and it now stands at 106 marks.)
	  <li>2017-11-20 14:45: tidied up the dates and times piece of
	    the <a href="notes/slides.pdf">lecture notes</a>.
	  <li>2017-11-19 22:15: there is no assignment due this week,
	    so I think I will <em>cancel tutorials</em> this week. I
	    will be available in my office during tutorial times, 11-1
	    and 3-5, if you want to find me.
	  <li>2017-11-19 22:00: on this week's agenda (after a little
	  consideration from me): categorical variables in regression
	  (Tuesday) and dates and times (Thursday). This is a bit out
	  of order, but I will get back to the serious business of R
	    functions next week. There should be a non-assignment on
	  these things later in the week.

	    <p>I am just uploading the <a href="notes/slides.pdf">updated
	    lecture notes</a>. As I read through it, I think I have to
	    tidy up some of the SAS stuff on dates and times, so there
	    might be another update before Thursday.
	  <li>2017-11-19 21:30: I spent today's subway ride writing up
	    some thoughts on <a href="catreg0.pdf">regression with
	    categorical variables</a>. This goes over some ground
	    covered in the last question
	    of <a href="assignments/a85.pdf">assignment 8.5</a>, but
	    in SAS as well. I will merge these notes into the main
	    lecture notes, but you can use the link above to get at
	    them separately. I plan to talk about this in Tuesday's
	    lecture. Here are the links to the
	    tidied <a href="pigs2.txt">pigs data</a> and the
	    tidied <a href="crickets2.csv">crickets data</a>.
	  <li>2017-11-18
	  12:00: <a href="assignments/a85.pdf">"Assignment 8.5"</a>,
	  some practice questions on multiple regression, is up.
	  <li>2017-11-17 11:30: I promised no more assignments to hand
	  in, but I have some "assignment" questions on this week's
	  stuff, which I will put up in due course as Assignment 8.5
	  (with solutions), for you to work through. There will
	  probably be some other fractionally-numbered non-assignments on
	    the material in the last two weeks of lectures.
	    <p> Just so that you know, we have done what we are going
	  to do on regression (edit: except for the stuff on
	  regression with categorical variables), so if your chosen
	  project looks like a regression, you can get to work on it
	  now.

	      <p> It just occurred to me that I would like to talk
	      about regression with categorical variables, but I don't
	      have anything in the lecture notes about that. So I may
	      write up some extra stuff about that, and let you know
	      where to find it.
	  <li>2017-11-17 11:30:
	  my <a href="assignments/a8.pdf">solutions to assignment
	  8</a> are up. The grader knows that there are several possible
	  ways to tackle things and will mark accordingly.
	  <li>2017-11-13
	  13:00: <a href="assignments/a8.pdf">Assignment 8</a> is up
	  on Blackboard.
	  <li>2017-11-13 13:00: I forgot to
	  upload <a href="assignments/a7.pdf">my solutions to
	  assignment 7</a>. They are up now.
	  <li>2017-11-08 11:00: thanks to those who told me
	  that <a href="assignments/a7.pdf">assignment 7</a> question
	  1 was missing its solutions. Fixed now. Heading for tutorial.
	  <li>2017-11-06 12:00: I
	  think <a href="assignments/a8.pdf">Assignment 8</a> is ready
	  to go for next week. There is one data-management question
	  and one regression question, reflecting what we're doing in
	  class this week. This is a longish assignment, but it's the
	  last one, so I figure you can cope.
	  <li>2017-11-06 09:45: on the agenda for this week:
	  reorganizing data using SAS, and the first (probably) of our
	  three case studies. The case studies illustrate various
	  aspects of regression, and so may be useful to you in
	  preparation for your project. There are three case studies,
	    so we'll be looking at these this week and next.

	    <p>I currently have an enormously long Assignment 8, which
	    I will edit down over the next couple of days. This will
	    be the last assignment to hand in and will be due on
	    November 16.
	  <li>2017-11-03 13:00: I made a few small clarifications
	  to <a href="assignments/a7.pdf">Assignment 7</a>. None of
	  the questions changed. I am about to put it up on Blackboard.
	  <li>2017-11-03 10:30:
	  my <a href="assignments/a6.pdf">assignment 6 solutions</a>
	  up. 
	  <li>2017-11-02 16:00: extra exam pick-up time Monday
	  11:00-11:15am in my office.
	  <li>2017-11-02 16:00: the final exam is scheduled for
	  Thursday December 7 at 9:00am (three-hour exam) in SW 309
	  and SW 319. There are only three days between the course
	  project being due and the final exam, so you will have to
	  budget your time between the project and preparation  for
	  the final exam. We have some more material to cover on
	  regression that may be helpful for your project. This is
	  coming up soon. (Getting started on your project as soon as
	  you can, once we have covered appropriate material in class,
	    would be a good idea.)

	    <p> It is likely that I will still be marking projects
	    when the final exam is being written, so there may be a
	    delay between the final exam and grades being available. 
	  <li>2017-11-02 16:00: instructions for
	  the <a href="assignments/project.pdf">course project</a> are
	  now final. 
	  <li>2017-11-02 11:00: last Thursday's missing lecture is now
	  recorded, and will be up soon. I now have to get my mind
	  around today's lecture!
	  <li>2017-11-01 09:45: extra exam pickup times: today (Wed)
	  2:00-2:15pm, Thursday after class 1:00-1:15 (and before
	  class in office hours).
	  <li>2017-10-30 22:30: Here
	  is <a href="assignments/a7.pdf">assignment 7</a> as it
	  stands now. There will be an assignment 8, which will be the
	  last "official" one (with something to hand in). However,
	  there will be one or two "fractional" assignments with
	  numbers like 8.5 and 8.75, on the last two weeks of
	  material (but with nothing to hand in), so that you get a
	  chance to prepare properly for the final exam.
	  <li>2017-10-30 13:00: I have arranged with the WebOption
	  people to record last Thursday's lecture. This will happen
	    on Thursday morning of <em>this</em> week, so that
	  tomorrow's lecture is likely to be up first, but both
	  lectures will be up eventually. With that in mind, I will do
	  a little bit of R Markdown review tomorrow, but I won't have
	  time to do much.
	  <li>2017-10-30 11:30: there was a mixup with the weboption
	  scheduling last Thursday, so we don't currently have a
	  recording of last Thursday's lecture. I am working with the
	  weboption people to see what we can do about that.
	  <li>2017-10-30 11:00: on the agenda for this week's
	  lectures: finish the R Markdown stuff, and then onto
	  "tidying and organizing data", which begins with R and gets
	  (eventually) onto SAS.
	  <li>2017-10-29 13:30: I am about to put the midterm marks up
	  on Blackboard. The exam is out of 80, with the percentage
	    also displayed. Median mark was 55 (69%), Q1 was 46 (58%),
	    Q3 was 63 (79%). Highest mark was 75. By the standards of
	    this course, this was a fairly straightforward exam; there
	    were only a few places requiring careful thought.

	    <p> I am convinced that I have marked these exams
	    consistently with each other and with the marking scheme,
	    so therefore do not expect me to change any marks.

	      <p> The only exception is if I have
	    made an error, which is one of these:
	      <ul>
		<li>adding up the marks on a page incorrectly
		<li>mis-copying the mark at the bottom of the page to
		  the table on the front of the exam
		<li>adding up the marks on the front page
		    incorrectly
		<li>incorrectly copying the mark on your exam
		  to Blackboard.
	      </ul>

	      <p>I will of course correct any of these. Draw my
	      attention to it. I may need to borrow your exam to check
	      that I am correcting all my errors.
	      
	      <p>A mark that you disagree with is not
		an error. Look at <a href="midterm.pdf">my exam
		  solutions</a> to see why I marked it as I did. (Note
		that I do not give half points.)

	      <p> You can collect your exam from me in my office hours
	      (or, if inconvenient, make an appointment by email). I
	      will need to see your student card to be sure that I am
		giving the exam back to the right person. If you do
	      not collect your exam, you are wasting an opportunity to
	      learn how you might do better on the final exam.

	      <p> If you are disappointed by your mark,
		do <em>not</em> complain to me. You need to
		do <em>all</em> of the following:

		<ol>
		  <li>Collect your exam from me.
		  <li>Check for addition and transcription errors, as
		    described above. If you find any, let me know and
		    I will correct them.
		  <li>Go through the exam carefully with my solutions
		    until you are clear why you got the mark you did,
		    and until you understand what you needed to do to
		    get full marks. (The solutions contain details
		    about what kind of answer was worth how many points.)
		  <li>Make a study plan for the rest of the
		    course. This will certainly include coming to
		    every single lecture (and, if necessary, watching
		    the WebOption video as well later), and will probably
		    include working through all of the questions on
		    the assignments, not just the ones you need to
		    hand in, and reading carefully through my
		    solutions. This will help you learn what is important in
		    this course. It should go without saying that you
		    must do your own work on the assignments;
		    otherwise you waste an opportunity to learn things
		    for yourself that will help you on the exams (and
		    beyond this course). If you are stuck, <em>get
		    help</em>. That's what office hours are for.
		</ol>

	      <P> I want you to succeed in this course, and will do my
	      best to help you, but you also need to do what it takes
		to help <em>yourself</em>, so that you can demonstrate
	      mastery of the course on the final exam.

	      <p>If you failed the midterm, consider whether you have
		  a strong enough background to learn the material in
		  this course. (A 55 in a prerequisite course means
		  that you did not learn very much there.) If your
		  background is weak, think about whether you would
		  benefit from taking this course later rather than
		  now.
	    
	  <li>2017-10-28 23:00: part way through totalling up. My
	  process is to add the marks with an abacus (usually most
	  reliable for me) and then to do one of the following checks:
	    (i) add up from the end of the list in my head, (ii) add up the
	  marks <em>dropped</em> on the abacus. If these don't give
	  the same answer I check again. (My commonest errors on the
	  abacus are to be off by 5 or 10, and these catch those.)
	  Hoping to get the exam marks up tomorrow.
	  <li>2017-10-28 22:00: I may start with the totalling up
	  tonight, since that doesn't have to be done in one
	    sitting. Here is the (possibly) final version
	  of <a href="midterm.pdf">my exam solutions</a>.
	  <li>2017-10-28 21:30: all the actual marking is done! I now
	  have to (a) add and record the last page, (b) add up all the
	  marks, (c) sort the exams into alphabetical order, (d)
	  record the marks on Blackboard. With so many exams, these
	  are non-trivial tasks and won't all get done tonight.
	  <li>2017-10-28 20:15: 8(b) done. The end is in sight!
	  <li>2017-10-28 18:15: 8(a) done. If I have enough energy I
	  might even be done marking tonight!
	  <li>2017-10-28 16:45: reminder
	  that <a href="assignments/a6.pdf">Assignment 6</a> is due on
	  Thursday. 
	  <li>2017-10-28 13:00: page 7 added up and recorded while
	  Megan was doing her homework.
	  <li>2017-10-28 10:30: I finally remembered to upload
	  the <a href="bmi.Rmd">R Markdown</a> document that we were
	  working on in class on Thursday. Download it, save it, and
	  open it in R Studio. Feel free to play with adding to it. I
	  may embellish it myself later.
	  <li>2017-10-27 21:15: 7(c) done while Megan was watching
	  videos. Now I need to get her to bed.
	  <li>2017-10-27 13:00: meeting shorter than expected, 7(b)
	  done in one sitting (afterwards).
	  <li>2017-10-27 11:30: 7(a) done. I was hoping to get
	  further, but I have a meeting at 12 and I prefer to go all
	  the way through the pile at one sitting, so I won't start
	  7(b) yet.
	  <li>2017-10-26 22:45: page 6 added up and recorded. Two
	  pages to go, starting tomorrow.
	  <li>2017-10-26 21:30: 6(d) done.
	  <li>2017-10-26 20:30: 6(c) done. I seem to have added a lot
	  of comments to my solutions on this one. I will upload the R
	  Markdown code from class today, but later, since it
	  involves actual thinking on my part.
	  <li>2017-10-25 23:30: I just uploaded the latest version
	  of <a href="midterm.pdf">my midterm solutions</a>, up to the
	  first two parts of the sign test question. I won't be able
	  to get back to the marking until (likely) tomorrow
	    evening. We're looking at sometime next week for marks.

	    <p>Tomorrow's class will continue the discussion on
	    report-writing, with a look at R Markdown later in the
	    hour. I have the usual office hours before class, but I
	      have to run off after class.

	      <p>Looking ahead: it appears that we will be having an
	      early final exam. This will be not long after your
	      project is due (December 4), and so you will have to
	      budget your time carefully to be properly prepared for
		the final exam.

	      <p> Talking of the project, here
	      are <a href="project.pdf">last year's
	      instructions</a>. I don't imagine I'll make any large
	      changes this year. The story is: pick one of the data
	      sets (or use one of your own), do a sufficiently
	      thoughtful analysis of the data, using what we have
	      learned in this class, and write a report
	      describing what you found, the report being structured
	      as we are seeing in class now. Sometimes I am able to
	      give feedback, but the way things are this year, the
	      only feedback you are likely to get is the mark. The due
	      date is December 4 at 11:59pm, but if you hand it in
	      then, you are unlikely to have the project mark in hand
	      before you write the final exam. Earlier is better.
	  <li>2017-10-25 23:00: 6(b) done. That's as far as I go
	  tonight. I'm drinking the ginger tea now. It did get burnt,
	  but it's a very curious taste. I've never experienced
	  anything liquid before that tastes so much like bacon. 
	  <li>2017-10-25 21:45: 6(a) done. Maybe one more time through
	  the pile tonight. I made some ginger tea to help my cold,
	  but the water nearly boiled away as I was marking, and so it
	  will now probably have that oh-so-attractive burnt taste.
	  <li>2017-10-25 15:40: 5(c) done, faster than I thought.
	  <li>2017-10-25 14:55: 5(b) done. Fast going.
	  <li>2017-10-25 14:15: 5(a) done. Tea required.
	  <li>2017-10-25 12:30: back in the saddle. 4(c) is done, and
	  in a few moments, page 4 will be history.
	  <li>2017-10-24 16:15: I forgot to mention in class, so will
	  say here now: NO TUTORIALS TOMORROW, since there is no
	  assignment due.
	  <li>2017-10-24 16:00: question 4(b) done, on the tail end of
	    office hours.
	  <li>2017-10-23 23:00: question 4(a) done. That's it for
	  tonight. 
	  <li>2017-10-23 20:45: question 3 done. Beginning to slow
	  down. I hope I'm through the two longest questions.
	  <li>2017-10-23 17:00: 3(d) finally done. Heading home for
	  dinner, more tonight (with luck).
	  <li>2017-10-23 15:45: 3(c) done.
	  <li>2017-10-23 14:45: 3(b) done. That went quickly. I need a
	  cup, or perhaps more accurately, a pot of tea.
	  <li>2017-10-23 14:00: 3(a) done. I have the Accessability
	    exams, so now I can post <a href="midterm.pdf">my exam
	    solutions</a>, and the 
	    <a href="midterm-figures.pdf">code and output</a> (in case
	    you didn't take it with you). The solutions will evolve as
	    I mark more. Next, I have to catch up the Accessability
	    exams to the other large pile.
	    <li>  2017-10-23 11:30: back to work. Question 2 done.
	<li>2017-10-22 22:20: 2(d) done, but that's my limit for tonight.
	<li>2017-10-22 21:15: 2(c) done. Losing steam, but may try for
	one more turn through the pile tonight.
	<li>2017-10-22 20:15: back after dinner. 2(b) done.
	<li>2017-10-22 16:00: question 2(a) done. I need to take a
	walk in the sunshine.
	<li>2017-10-22 14:30: lunch. Page 1 is done, but with this
	many exams, it takes a long time to add up and record the
	marks for a page!
	<li>2017-10-22 12:30: back to work marking exams. I have now
	finished 1(c), and intend to get page 1 finished before lunch.
	<li>2017-10-21 21:00: the absurdly long journey of marking
	your midterms has begun. Everyone's question 1(a) is marked. I
	am collecting additional comments as I mark, which I will add
	to my solutions. I will put those up once I have the exams
	  from Accessability, which will probably be Monday. I think
	that is as far as I will get tonight.

	  <p> I have a sore throat today (which is why I let Nnenna do
	  the announcements at the exam), which, as usually happens
	  for me, is likely to turn into a cold. I hope I will have
	  voice enough for class on Tuesday, and I will try not to get
	    anything too noxious on your exam paper!

	  <p> Reminder, before I forget: assignment 6 is due
	  on <em>November 2</em>, so you have a week off before that is
	  due. (It is up on Blackboard if you want to get started;
	  Tuesday's class will get you most of the way through the
	  material.)  With that in mind, there are <em>no
	  tutorials</em> this week. If you want to talk, catch me in
	  office hours. You will probably find me hidden behind a
	    large pile of exams.

	  <p> Yes, that was Megan at the exam today. She did get some
	  homework done, but she found the page-turning a distraction,
	  so she spent most of the exam watching Mario Kart videos!
	    
	<li>2017-10-20 09:30: <a href="assignments/a5.pdf">My
	solutions to assignment 5</a>. Look them over (particularly
	the last two questions) before the exam.
	<li>2017-10-16 23:00: discovered today: on the 2016 exam, in
	the question about coffee cups, one of the plots appeared as a
	nonsensical histogram when it should have been a boxplot. I
	have now corrected this, so if you re-download the 2016
	midterm, it should now look as you would expect.
	<li>2017-10-16 15:00: I have also updated my solutions to the
	2015 midterm, in the light of what I would expect you to say
	this year. This is about as far back as I am able to go
	right now.
	<li>2017-10-16 12:30: I have just added to the solutions
	for <a href="oldexams/mid16s.pdf">last year's midterm</a>,
	adding "2017 solutions" where what I expect you to answer is
	different to the answer I expected last year. The nature of
	this course is that the best way to do something changes over
	time. Bear that in mind as you go further back into the past.
	<li>2017-10-12
	14:15: <a href="assignments/a55.pdf">"Assignment 5.5"</a>, a
	few practice questions to look over before the
	midterm. Nothing to hand in. Some of these may make more sense
	  after next Tuesday's lecture.
	<li>2017-10-12 14:00: I have an updated version
	of <tt>smmr</tt>. If you are having trouble with it,
	  re-install it. I have added some alternatives
	to <a href="assignments/a5.pdf">Assignment 5</a> to give you
	some extra options. (I haven't changed the file on
	Blackboard, so use the link here.) 
	<li>2017-10-12 12:30: on the agenda next week: one more thing
	about normal quantile plots (slide 276 and on), Mood's median
	test (slides 295 and on), Analysis of Variance (slides 313 and
	on). It's up to you to figure out what is on the midterm and
	what is not, which you can do by coming to the lecture or by
	  watching
	the <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/weboption/">WebOption</a>
	video (click Lecturecast Login).
	<li>2017-10-12 11:30: timetable of upcoming events:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Tuesday October 17: lecture as usual (last material
	    for midterm)
	    <li>Wednesday October 18: tutorials as usual. Take the
	    opportunity to ask about midterm stuff if you've finished
	    Assignment 5.
	    <li>Thursday October 19: lecture as usual. Material here
	    is <em>not</em> on midterm but will be on Assignment 6.
	    <li>Thursday October 19: pre-exam office hours after
	    lecture (1:00-4:30pm).
	    <li>Saturday October 21: midterm exam 9:00-11:00am in IC
	    130
	    <li>Tuesday October 24: lecture as usual. Assignment 6
	    goes out, due Thursday November 2.
	    <li>Wednesday October 25: <em>No</em> tutorials. You don't
	    have an assignment due, and I need time to mark the exams,
	    so this seems a better use of time.
	    <li>Thursday October 26: lecture as usual. <em>No</em>
	    assignment due.
	    <li>Tuesday October 31: back to the usual routine.
	    <li>Thursdays November 9 and 16: planned due dates for
	    Assignments 7 and 8. There will be 8 assignments
	    altogether.
	    <li>Monday December 4: Project due. I will talk about this
	    later, after I have discussed statistical reports.
	  </ul>
	<li>2017-10-11 13:45: the midterm is almost ready to be sent
	for printing. I will try to get it sent off this afternoon (I
	am on the final phase of checking it over). The exam has 8
	questions on 8 pages (with space to write answers), covering
	material up to and including what we will look at next Tuesday
	in class. It will be like the old exams in that you will also
	receive a booklet of code and output containing numbered
	Figures to refer to during the exam. As for the kind of things
	  I will ask, expect two possibilities:
	  <ul>
	    <li>give code to perform a specific task
	    <li>look at output and answer questions on it.
	  </ul>
	  In an ideal world, I would put you in front of a computer
	  for your exams in this course, so you would have the benefit
	  of trying your code and fixing it if it doesn't work. But we
	  have to work with the world we have, so it is a written exam
	  and you'll have to write your code by hand. I try to make
	  the exams like the assignments, except for the bit of you
	  actually running your code.
	<li>2017-10-11 13:45: re: assignment 5, I just spoke to a
	student who couldn't get sign_test in package smmr to work
	because of not having a function called "enquo". If this happens
	to you, first make sure you have the most up-to-date version
	  of the tidyverse: run <tt>tidyverse_update()</tt> and let it
	update anything it needs to. If that doesn't help, I will
	provide a fix (probably available tomorrow) and update the
	practice question(s) on assignment 5 to show you how it
	works. 
	<li>2017-10-06 16:00: What's coming up in lectures? After
	reading week, we have one piece of the normal quantile plot
	picture to take care of (slide 278), and then we can move on
	to Mood's median test, which is the two-sample version of the
	sign test. Whatever we cover in Tuesday's lecture may be on
	the midterm. There is a lecture on the Thursday before the
	midterm, the contents of which <em>will</em> be on assignment
	6 and <em>will</em> be on the final exam. I will have pre-exam
	office hours on either the Thursday or the Friday before the
	exam (I have to figure out my schedule first).
	<li>2017-10-06 15:45: <a href="assignments/a4.pdf">My
	solutions</a> to assignment 4. These are a bit long because
	there are several different ways to tackle power (especially
	in SAS) and I wanted to talk about at least some of them. (I
	learned quite a bit by seeing what people were doing on
	Wednesday.) 
	<li>2017-10-06 15:30: Here is the final version
	of <a href="assignments/a5.pdf">Assignment 5</a>. I took out
	the question about insurance and simplified the sign-test
	question. Both the remaining questions use both R and
	SAS. They are a bit long, but they are entirely
	straightforward applications of the sign test and the matched
	pairs t-test. So they ought not to take you too long to
	do. The questions will also be good preparation for the
	midterm, given that both the sign test and matched-pairs
	testing could be on the exam. This assignment will be due on
	October 19, shortly before the midterm, but you have nearly
	two weeks to work on it, so you would do well to get this out
	of the way to give you enough time to study for the exam. 
	<li>2017-10-05 14:45: I want to shorten Assignment 5: to two
	  questions, and maybe shortening that first question that
	  goes up to part (h). I haven't figured out how yet,
	  though. Stay tuned.
	  <p> There's one tiny piece of normal quantile plots that we
	  didn't do yet: how to estimate $\mu$ and $\sigma$ using the
	  IQR so that the line on a SAS normal quantile plot is more
	  reasonable. That's the first item on the agenda for after
	  reading week. After that, we can pick up where we left off
	  today. 
	<li>2017-10-04 13:30: I forgot to put the Assignment 4 hand-in
	on Blackboard. It's there now. Thanks to those who reminded
	me. 
	<li>2017-10-02 13:00: a
	draft <a href="assignments/a5.pdf">Assignment 5</a> is
	up. There are currently three questions to hand in; I may
	shorten this for the assignment you actually have to hand in. 
	<li>2017-10-02 11:30: on the agenda this week: finishing off
	the sign test (slides 239-258), matched pairs (slides
	259-271), normal quantile plot (272-290) and possibly the sign
	  test on matched-pair data. I might shuffle the order, for
	example looking at the normal quantile plot earlier.

	  <p>Next week (Oct 9-13) is Reading Week. There are no
	    lectures or tutorials, and there will be no assignment due.

	  <p>With that in mind, Assignment 5, on this week's stuff,
	    will be due the following week, on October 19, so you will
	    have an extra week to do it.

	  <p> The midterm exam is scheduled for October 21 (Saturday)
	  9:00-11:00 am in IC 130. I believe this is official now (I
	  will check). The material on the midterm will be whatever we
	  cover up in lecture to and including the Tuesday before the
	  exam. You are responsible for knowing what that is. (This
	  includes what is on Assignment 5.) The exam is open book as
	  detailed in the course outline.  I will give you a week off
	  assignments after the midterm; I may cancel tutorials that
	  week so I can get the midterms marked more quickly.
	<li>2017-09-29 10:00:
	my <a href="assignments/a3.pdf">assignment 3 solutions</a>.
	<li>2017-09-29 09:00: SAS went down last night, but is back up
	now. It looks as if everybody managed to hand in their
	assignment 3 somehow. I will accept any assignments that came
	in between midnight and now. Remember what it said in the
	course outline: be prepared for software to go down. If you
	leave your assignment until the last minute, this could happen
	to you again, and you might not be so lucky next time.
	<li>2017-09-27 13:34: next week I'd like to talk about the
	normal quantile plot, since I saw a number of you using it
	this week. Maybe I'll start with that, and then get back to
	the sign test. The normal quantile plot starts on page 272 of
	the lecture notes.
	<li>2017-09-27 13:45: <a href="assignments/a4.pdf">Assignment
	4</a> is good as it is. I decided not to change anything in it.
	<li>2017-09-26 23:15: It seems I didn't scroll down far
	enough. There are a few Assignment 1's not marked yet. If you
	have "grade pending", that would be the reason.
	<li>2017-09-26 22:00: I managed to mess up displaying the
	grades for Assignment 1 on Blackboard. I've fixed it now. Try
	it again now.
	<li>2017-09-25 17:15: there is
	a <em>draft</em> <a href="assignments/a4.pdf">Assignment 4</a>
	up. Bear in mind that I may make edits to this between now and
	next week.
	<li>2017-09-25 16:00: I requested a midterm
	date <em>after</em> the reading week. As soon as I have an
	official date I will let you know. I am planning to give you a
	week off assignments around the midterm. My usual plan for a
	week like that is to give you something like "Assignment 5.5"
	with nothing to hand in, but with some practice questions for
	the stuff we've just done in class.
	<li>2017-09-25 15:45: on the agenda for this week is  power of
	tests, by simulation and by calculation (well, R and SAS will
	do the calculation for us). On the way, I want to talk a bit
	more about functions in R (than appears in the lecture notes
	now) because they serve as building blocks for bigger
	things. I'm expecting that I will later get to talk about how
	hypothesis tests and confidence intervals are related, and
	that leads on to the sign test (which I may or may not get to
	this week). So, on assignment 4, expect to see some questions
	about power and type II errors.
	<li>2017-09-25 15:45: the assignment 1's appear to have been
	  all marked now. <a href="assignments/a3.pdf">Assignment
	  3</a> is now up on Blackboard, so you can hand it in when
	  you have finished it. I am currently working on assignment 4.
	<li>2017-09-23 22:15:
	my <a href="assignments/a2.pdf">solutions to assignment 2</a>.
	<li>2017-09-20 13:50: the
	updated <a href="assignments/a3.pdf">assignment 3</a> is
	up. This will be due <em>next week Thursday</em> (the 28th).
	<li>2017-09-20 11:50: off to the 12:00 tutorial 
	(which <em>does</em> take place as scheduled). The improved
	version of assignment 3 is almost ready to put up.
	<li>2017-09-20 11:30: We got further in lecture yesterday than
	I expected, so I think it is a good idea to put a two-sample
	t-test question on assignment *3*, next week's assignment (and
	take out one of the questions that is currently there). Expect
	to see that up later today. (Assignment 2, the one you are
	working on now, will not be changed.)
	<li>2017-09-20 11:15: Sorry, I screwed up. If you were in the
	11:00 tutorial, you will have discovered that there was
	another class in the computer lab at our time today. I had
	actually scheduled 10:00 for us today, and proceeded (a) not
	to tell you and (b) not to show up myself. If you should have
	been in the 11:00 tutorial, feel free to come to one of the
	other tutorials today (12, 3 or 4 in the same room). Sorry. My
	  fault.
	<li>2017-09-18 12:30: I have
	put <a href="assignments/a2.pdf">Assignment 2</a> up on
	Blackboard. If you have done it already, you can hand it
	  in. If you are <em>really</em> keen, you can start work
	on <a href="assignments/a3.pdf">Assignment 3</a>, which is
	based on this week's lectures (and therefore will begin to
	make sense after tomorrow's class). I won't put Assignment 3
	on Blackboard yet, since I don't want to confuse the issue. If
	I remember, it will go up on Friday, after Assignment 2 is
	handed in. 
	<li>2017-09-18 11:30:
	my <a href="assignments/a1.pdf">solutions to assignment 1</a>,
	I realize, were actually generated from a different file than
	the questions. There is, however, no inconsistency as far as I
	can tell. Let me know if you find any. (For example, the text
	of the solutions to the questions that had solutions before
	should be the same, except that I might have added a few
	things. Nothing should have been removed, though I got the
	date mixed up, which I fixed.) One of the links was to the
	wrong file, which is now fixed.
	<li>2017-09-15 11:00: I've been thinking about next week's
	classes, and therefore what should go on assignment 3. My
	guess is that we will spend all of Tuesday's class and
	probably some of Thursday's on one-sample inference (the
	one-sample t), and so my current plan is to put only that
	stuff on assignment 3. We will probably start the two-sample
	inference, but I'm not sure we'll finish it, so I think I will
	defer questions on that to Assignment 4. After that comes the
	lecture stuff on power of tests and sample sizes, so you might
	get questions on both of those on Assignment 4. (I am
	conscious that I don't want to make the assignments too long,
	so we'll see how it turns out.)
	<li>2017-09-15 10:00: My <a href="assignments/a1.pdf">assignment 1
	solutions</a>. Even if you thought Assignment 1 was easy, it
	is worth your while reading through these, because I have gone
	beyond the questions I asked you, and you might get some more
	insight. 
	<li>2017-09-14 17:40: next week we start on statistical
	inference (section 6 of the notes, which is a very long
	section). I will assume that you have seen this stuff before,
	but that you might have forgotten the details. We start with
	the one-sample t confidence interval and test (for the mean of
	a single sample); at some point, maybe later in the week, we look
	at the two-sample t, which has some extra wrinkles that you
	have probably not seen before. I will figure out how far we
	are likely to get next week, and put something corresponding
	on your Assignment 3. 
	<li>2017-09-14 17:30: about the SAS part of the North Carolina
	births data. It seems that SAS Studio reads the variable names
	in including spaces and question marks as they are, which
	makes it very difficult to duplicate what I did. I added some
	extra discussion to the appropriate part
	of <a href="assignments/a2.pdf">Assignment 2</a>, which you
	can read, but the TL;DR is that you need to add the
	line <tt>options validvarname=v7;</tt> to the top of your SAS
	code, and then SAS will convert the column names to "valid
	variable names" for you the same as it did for
	me. (You <em>only</em> need to do this if you have column
	names with spaces and other junk in them; if your data set is
	junk-free, as it usually will be, at least in this course, you
	don't need to do this.)
	<li>2017-09-14 17:30: the Australian athletes data
	  is <a href="ais.txt">here</a>. Copy the URL from the address
	  bar into R or SAS to use it. The data values are separated
	  by <em>tabs</em>.
	<li>2017-09-13 12:30: This week's lectures: Tuesday, section 3
	(graphs), Thursday section 4 (short) and 5 (numerical
	summaries). Assignment 2 will be on those two things.
	<li>2017-09-13 12:30: I imagine you don't care yet, but here
	is <a href="assignments/a2.pdf">Assignment 2</a>, which will
	be due next week. It contains some more work on graphs
	(today's class) and numerical summaries (Thursday's class).
	<li>2017-09-07 14:30: one more thing: all the data files I use in class should be web-accessible. For example, a file called <tt>soap.txt</tt> should be accessible at <tt>http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/soap.txt</tt>. For a file of another name, replace <tt>soap.txt</tt> with the name of the file. Let me know if you find anything missing.
	<li>2017-09-07 13:30: I forgot to mention in class today that you should feel free to follow along with the code during class (it might be a bit fast) or afterwards. I was told that the text in R Studio and SAS Studio didn't show up clearly on the WebOption video, so will try to make it bigger next time.

	  <p> If you want some practice on the stuff we did in class today, take a look at Assignment 1, in particular the problems with solutions (the first three, this time). This will also get you ahead of the game for the graph stuff on Tuesday.
	<li>2017-09-07 11:30: In tutorial yesterday, several people found that they could not get Word output out of SAS Studio (and that copying and pasting HTML was not getting graphs). I found out how to fix this:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Go to SAS Studio.
	      <li>Look top right. You'll see "SAS Programmer", a funny
	      symbol with three lines and some dots, a question mark,
	      and "Sign out".
		<li>The one that is three lines and some dots has a
		tooltip "More Application Options". Click it.
		  <li>Select Preferences from the pop-up menu.
		    <li>Click Results (on the left).
		      <li>Look for RTF on the right. Click the box
		      next to "Produce RTF Output" and make sure it
		      has a check mark in it.
			<li>Click Save.
			  <li>Open some SAS code and run it. The Word
			  link should no longer be greyed out.
			  <li>Click on the Word link. It will download
			  a file containing the results and graphs,
			  which you can open in Word, and copy-paste
			  into your assignment document.
			    <li>This should continue to work in the
			    future (that is, you won't need to do it
			    again).
	  </ul>
	<li>2017-09-07 11:00: <a href="assignments/a1.pdf">Assignment
	1</a> is up. It's under Course Materials on Blackboard. If you
	are unfamiliar with handing in work on Blackboard, you might
	like
	to <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/blackboard-assgt-howto.html">look
	at this</a>.
	
	<li>2017-09-07 09:30: I forgot to mention: we are on WebOption. Start <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/weboption/participating-courses">here</a>.

	  
	<li>2017-09-06 14:15: tomorrow's class will start from Section
	2 of the lecture notes. 

	  <p> The rest of section 1 is instructions about installing R
	  and connecting to SAS. Also there are instructions for
	  getting SAS to run on your own machine (so that you are not
	  battling for run-time on SAS's servers). Be warned, the
	  process for running SAS on your own machine is rather complicated! 
But it is there if
	  you want to try it. (I won't be talking about these in
	  class.) 
	<li>2017-09-06 10:30: Tutorials start <em>today!</em>
	<li>2017-09-01 17:00: Lectures are Tuesday 13:00-14:00 in SW
	319 and Thursday 12:00-13:00 in IC 130. Office hours will be
	Tuesday after class and Thursday before class. If you want to
	see me outside of those times, make an appointment or take
	your chances.
	<li>2017-09-01 16:45: Tutorials begin in the <em>first</em>
	week of classes. This is because you will need to get some
	things in place before the first assignment is due (week 2),
	and it is better for you to be able to work through those
	  things with help if you need it.

	  <p> This course has WebOption. The lectures will be recorded
	  and will be available for two weeks. I spoke to the guy in
	  charge of WebOption today; anything that appears on the big
	  screen in class, slides or software, will also appear on the
	  WebOption video, plus you can access my entire lecture notes
	  from up there at the top left.
	<li>2017-09-01 16:30: We have a fourth tutorial Wed 11-12 in
	BV 498. This is official. At the moment, tutorials 1 and 2 are
	full and tutorial 3 is almost full, so if your schedule allows
	for you to go to tutorial 4, feel free to switch to it. This
	will also free up space for those students whose schedules are
	  more constrained.

	  <p> You will want to be in one of the tutorials by the start
	  of classes.
	<li>2017-08-28 10:30: we are shooting for Wed 11-12 for the
	fourth tutorial, but not official yet.
	<li>2017-08-21 16:30: it looks as if room has been found for
	everyone on the wait list. We will need to arrange one more
	computer-lab tutorial (you will want to be enrolled in one
	eventually). 
	<li>2017-08-15 12:00: Course news will go here, most recent at
	the top.
      </ul>
