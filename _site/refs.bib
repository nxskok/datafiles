	abstract = {The hypothesis of the present study was that low-repetition and high-impact training of 10 maximum vertical jumps/day, 3 times/wk would be effective for improving bone mineral density (BMD) in ordinary young women. Thirty-six female college students, with mean age, height, and weight of 20.7 {\textpm} 0.7 yr, 158.9 {\textpm} 4.6 cm, and 50.4 {\textpm} 5.5 kg, respectively, were randomly divided into two groups: jump training and a control group. After the 6 mo of maximum vertical jumping exercise intervention, BMD in the femoral neck region significantly increased in the jump group from the baseline (0.984 {\textpm} 0.081 vs. 1.010 {\textpm} 0.080 mg/cm2; P \&lt; 0.01), although there was no significant change in the control group (0.985 {\textpm} 0.0143 vs. 0.974 {\textpm} 0.134 mg/cm2). And also lumbar spine (L2{\textendash}4) BMD significantly increased in the jump training group from the baseline (0.991 {\textpm} 0.115 vs. 1.015 {\textpm} 0.113 mg/cm2; P \&lt; 0.01), whereas no significant change was observed in the control group (1.007 {\textpm} 0.113 vs. 1.013 {\textpm} 0.110 mg/cm2). No significant interactions were observed at other measurement sites, Ward{\textquoteright}s triangle, greater trochanter, and total hip BMD. Calcium intakes and accelometry-determined physical daily activity showed no significant difference between the two groups. From the results of the present study, low-repetition and high-impact jumps enhanced BMD at the specific bone sites in young women who had almost reached the age of peak bone mass.},
