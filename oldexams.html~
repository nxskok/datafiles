<h1>Old Final Exams for STAD29 / STA 1007</h1>

Here are (as of March 20 2017) the old final exams, with solutions, of
all the versions of the course that were run with R. Prior to 2015,
the code and output was included with the exam:<br><br>

<table border>
  <tr>
    <th>Year <th>Exam<th>Solutions<th>Code/output
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2013<td><a href="final-20131.pdf">exam</a>
    <td><a href="finals-20131.pdf">solutions</a>
    <td>&nbsp;
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2014<td><a href="final-20141.pdf">exam</a>
    <td><a href="finals-20141.pdf">solutions</a>
    <td>&nbsp;
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2015<td><a href="final-20151-questions.pdf">exam</a>
    <td><a href="final-20151-solutions.pdf">solutions</a>
    <td><a href="final-20151-figures.pdf">code/output</a>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2016<td><a href="final-20161-questions.pdf">exam</a>
    <td><a href="final-20161-solutions.pdf">solutions</a>
    <td><a href="final-20161-figures.pdf">code/output</a>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>There is a continuous evolution in coding style over the
years. For example, this is the first year I have
used <tt>ggplot</tt>, and I have gradually been
introducing <tt>tidyverse</tt> ideas in the last couple of years. The
coding of three or four years ago is therefore not all the same that
you would see now. The statistical ideas are the same, however.

<br>Prior to 2013, the course used SAS. I doubt that those exams will be
very helpful to you.
