<h3>Computing preliminaries</h3>This is not a mathematical course, but
it does involve computing. Specifically, we will be using the
statistical package SAS: learning how to analyze data using the methods
we learn, and how to interpret the output.<br><h4>Why SAS?</h4>SAS has
been around for years (now on version 9), and has become the standard
in industry, government and suchlike places for "routine" statistical
analysis (that is, where more or less well-known statistical procedures
are to be used). If you can say, therefore, that you have experience
with SAS, it makes you that much more employable! SAS runs on Windows,
Unix, the Mac, etc; it is big, and expensive, but there are certain
common themes, and, as we will see, once you see how to run one
analysis, you can easily learn how to run another. SAS is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not </span>&nbsp;point-and-click:
you write a "program" and then run it, but you then have the advantage
of knowing exactly what you did, and being able to run the program
again, or modify it. Is SAS user-friendly? No. And we will be running
it in about the least user-friendly way possible. But if you can handle
this course, you'll be able to handle SAS later in whatever environment
you find it.<br><h4>SAS at UTSC</h4>U of T has a "site licence" for
SAS, and SAS is installed on the "mathlab" machine under Unix (actually
Linux). For this course, you will have access to this machine. To get
at "mathlab", you'll need a "ssh" program. I use Putty, which is free.
You can download it from putty.org -- click on the top link there, go
down to Binaries, and get putty.exe. It doesn't need installing: just
put it on your desktop (or elsewhere) and run it.<br><br>If you get
Putty, once you run it, you'll need to get it to connect to the right
place. In the "host name" box, type mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca, and make
sure, under "connection type", SSH is selected. You can save this
information (click the Save button bottom right) to save typing it in
again later. When everything is good, click Open, and log in with your
username and password (probably your UTSC intranet/email username and
password, but I will check). Then you'll be logged into Mathlab, with
highly fashionable white text on black background.<br><h4>Running SAS</h4>It
seems to be easier if you work within the home directory only (rather
than creating new directories/folders). Don't ask me why.<br><br>First get your data into a file. Type <span style="font-weight: bold;">pico </span>followed
by the name of a file to store your data in, like mydata.dat. This
opens a rudimentary text editor. If there is anything already in the
file, you'll see it, otherwise it'll be empty. At the bottom of the
screen is a list of things you might want to do: to do any of them,
hold down Control and press the key indicated (the keyboard shortcuts
are <span style="font-weight: bold;">not </span>the same as Windows).
Otherwise, type away. When you are ready to exit, type Control-X, and
allow the system to save the file under the name you gave.<br><br>Then you need your SAS code. Use <span style="font-weight: bold;">pico </span>again: type in your code, and save it in a file with extension <span style="font-weight: bold;">.sas</span> , such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">mysascode.sas . </span><br><br>Run SAS by typing (at the command line) <span style="font-weight: bold;">sas </span>&nbsp;followed by the name of your file, such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">sas mysascode.sas</span>
. This will either run successfully or it won't, but there'll be no
difference in what you see: just a cryptic message and a command prompt
either way. SAS produces two output files, a <span style="font-weight: bold;">.log </span>file and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">.lst </span>file with names like <span style="font-weight: bold;">mysascode.log </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold;">mysascode.lst</span> . <br><br>Look at the log file first: you can either use <span style="font-weight: bold;">pico </span>&nbsp;again, or type something like <span style="font-weight: bold;">less mysascode.log</span>, which shows you the file one screenful at a time (hit the space bar to move on to the next screenful, <span style="font-weight: bold;">b</span> to go back and <span style="font-weight: bold;">q</span>
to quit at any point). In the log file, SAS echoes back the commands
you submitted, and adds comments. If something worked, there'll be some
lines marked "NOTE:" explaining how many lines were read in from the
data file, what pages of output were produced, and so on. If not,
you'll see ERROR: and the thing that SAS didn't like will have an
underline below it. You might also see WARNING:, an indication that
something may not have turned out as you expect. If there are errors,
go back to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">.sas</span> file and fix them up, then run SAS again, and check the new log file to make sure that everything is OK this time. <br><br>Once everything is OK, take a look at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">.lst </span>file (<span style="font-weight: bold;">mysascode.lst </span>or whatever) using <span style="font-weight: bold;">pico</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">less</span>. This is your output. Do with it what you will.<br><br>This
may seem like a clunky, old-fashioned&nbsp;way of working, and to some
extent it is, but the advantage it has is that you don't have to rely
on remembering what items you chose from what menus to reconstruct what
you did: everything you did is there in the .sas file. You can run it
again as many times as you like, and you will always get the same
answers (unless you change your data or something like that). This is a
big plus in the industrial or governmental world, where anyone else can
run your .sas file to check that you got what you said you did. It
might also be a lifesaver if the analysis is part of your thesis and
you lost the output!<br><h4>Copying and pasting in Putty</h4>Getting
your output from SAS on mathlab is one thing, but you'll need to print
it out, annotate it or whatever to hand it in. Putty provides
mechanisms to copy and paste to and from Word or whatever else you use.
They are, however, not completely obvious.<br><br>Copying from Putty first. Display on the screen the thing you want to copy (using <span style="font-weight: bold;">pico </span>or <span style="font-weight: bold;">less </span>or even <span style="font-weight: bold;">cat</span>,
which displays the whole file without stopping when it gets to the end
of the screen). Point your cursor at the start of what you want to
copy, and drag until all of it is highlighted. The strange thing is
that it is already copied to the clipboard, as you can verify by
pasting into another document. I mention <span style="font-weight: bold;">cat </span>because this gives you a way of copying a whole large document (output file, say). In your Putty window, type something like <span style="font-weight: bold;">cat mysascode.lst</span> &nbsp;. The whole file will speed by, the last few lines of it remaining in the window. Click on the <span style="font-style: italic;">end</span>
of the file and drag upwards. The rest of the file will come back into
view. Keep going until&nbsp;you get back to the beginning. The whole
file is then copied, and you can paste the whole thing at once.<br><br>A
word about fonts. SAS's output comes in a fixed pitch font (in fact,
SAS's output looks just the same as it did when fixed-pitch screen
fonts were all there was). So when you're handling the output yourself
(eg. printing it to hand it in), always use a fixed-pitch font like
Courier, in a size small enough that lines from the SAS output are not
getting broken in two (which looks <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span>
ugly). Lucida Sans Unicode in 10 point works well for me. There also
seems to be a font called&nbsp;SAS Monospace, which properly handles
things like axes on plots.<br><br>Copying
from the outside world and pasting into Putty is also possible (for
example, you might want to copy some data over, or you might have
sketched out a SAS program on your own computer). Copy in the usual
way, then to paste into Putty, open a file with <span style="font-weight: bold;">pico</span>, then click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">right</span> mouse button when you're ready to paste. What you copied appears right away in your file on mathlab. <br><br>SAS,
as I mentioned, comes in flavours for all different operating systems.
Mathlab runs Linux (like Unix). The Windows version of SAS uses a
windowing environment, with code, log file and output appearing on the
screen, but the way it works is really much as described above. I have
it on my laptop, and may demonstrate it in class from time to time so
that you see what it looks like. If you ever need to use it yourself,
it'll be easy enough to learn once you've gotten used to our bare-bones
way of doing things.<br><br><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><h3>An alternative to Putty</h3><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There
is an alternative to Putty, called Bitvise Tunnelier, which does all
that Putty does, and more (at the price of being more complicated to
use). To download it, go&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bitvise.com/download-area">here</a> and save the installation file somewhere (eg. on your desktop). Double-click to install in the usual way.<br><br>When
you start Tunnelier, you'll see a window with a bunch of tabs (Login,
&nbsp;Options, Terminal, SFTP and so on). The only one you need to be
concerned with is Login. Go there, and enter mathlab.utsc.utoronto.ca
in Host (under Server). Port 22 is good. On the right, enter your
username (your login for mathlab), set Initial Method to Password, and
type your password into the box below. (In case you are worried about
passwords being saved on your computer, Tunnelier encrypts your
password before it saves it, so that even if someone gets into your
files, they won't be able to unravel this password.) When this is all
done, click Login at the bottom. You'll see some messages in the bottom
half of the window, and two new windows.<br><br>One, labelled "xterm",
looks and acts just like Putty; you run SAS, pico, less etc. through it
in the same way. The other one, labelled SFTP, is new. On the left
side, under Local Files, are files on your desktop (by default: you can
change it). On the right are your files on mathlab. To upload or
download, select the file you want to copy (in either window) and drag
it to the other one. (Or, single-click the file and then click the
Upload or Download buttons at the bottom, according to which way you
want the file to go). This means (a) you can write a SAS program
offline, upload it to mathlab and then run SAS on it, or (b) you can
download programs, output or whatever to your computer for editing or
printing</span>
