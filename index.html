Welcome
to the home page for STA 1007 / STAD29. This is the place to look for
all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc.) except for
assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on <a href="https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/77890">Quercus</a>.</font></p>

News here, most recent at the top:

<ul><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    <li>2019-04-15 12:00: grades submitted. They will come to you as
    soon as they have been approved. Everyone passed, and my special
      congratulations to the 12 people who earned A+ grades.

      <p> A couple of things about the grade calculation:
	<ul>
	  <li>I had four grading schemes: counting or not counting the
	    final exam instead of the midterm, and counting or not
	    counting the project according to the STA 1007 scheme (a
	    non-issue for most of you). You automatically get
	    whichever one comes out the highest. This was about an
	    even split between counting and not counting the midterm,
	    and one student benefitted from each of the project
	    options.
	  <li>I don't give grades one below a grade boundary. Thus,
	    for example, 79.6 becomes 80, but 79.4 is rounded down to
	    78. If you want the higher grade, you have to earn it.
	</ul>
    <li>2019-04-14 20:30: done grading! The nice thing about Crowdmark
    is that it does the adding up and recording for me. I have put the
    final exam marks on Quercus and will release them to you in a
    moment. Before I do that, the obligatory few remarks:

      <ul>
	<li>I don't like to fail people in this course, and this year,
	as in other years, it looks as if everyone will pass.
	<li>You will also shortly be receiving your marked exam by
	  email. I anticipate that by looking at this and my
	  solutions, you will be able to see why you got the mark you
	  did.
	<li>If you wish for any part of your final exam to be
	  regraded, file a petition through the Registrar's office
	  as usual.
	<li> You will now be in a position to calculate your
	  (unofficial) course grade. I will do the official
	  calculation tomorrow. If you do not like what you
	  got, <em>do not appeal to me</em>, since that is a waste
	  of everyone's time.
      </ul>
    <li>2019-04-14 19:15: 6(c) done. One more part to go.
    <li>2019-04-14 17:50: 6(b) done, at the speed of light.
    <li>2019-04-14 17:20: a circuit of the mall, and 6(a) done. I
    think I can finish grading tonight.
    <li>2019-04-14 15:50: question 5, and page 9, is done. Only one
    question to go. I think I could do with a walk around the mall, if
    I can get there without getting soaking wet.
    <li>2019-04-14 15:10: 5(f) is done. At least I knew what I was
    looking for this time. I want to have a walk outside, but looking
    out the window I don't want to have a walk outside. I'm hoping the
    grading is all downhill from here.
    <li>2019-04-14 13:50: 5(e) is finally done. And now I have to
    tackle (f) which is similar. I may need lunch first.
    <li>2019-04-14 10:35: 5(d) done. I need a cup of tea before I
    tackle (e) and (f).
    <li>2019-04-13 20:50: 5(c), and page 8, done. Today mainly
    featured time with Megan (including baking cookies), riding the
    subway to drop her off with mom, and going for a bike ride before
    dark. I think that is as much energy as I can summon tonight. The
    forecast for tomorrow appears to be good exam-marking weather!
    <li>2019-04-13 13:30: 5(b) done, while Megan watches Minecraft
    videos on YouTube.
    <li>2019-04-12 21:45: 5(a) done. Bedtime (for Megan and for me). 
    <li>2019-04-12 20:15: 4(e) done. There were some really nice
    ideas. I might venture into question 5 tonight, or I might not.
    <li>2019-04-12 18:00: 4(c) done. I have a feeling part (e) will be
    an adventure (questions beginning with "describe" tend to be fun
    and games to mark).
    <li>2019-04-12 11:50: 4(d) done (as expected, fast). Lunchtime,
    then I have to go get Megan. After we get back, I suspect she will
    be watching YouTube for a while, so I might get some more marking
    done then.
    <li>2019-04-12 11:25: 4(b) done. I think part (c) will take me
    longer than I have now, so I will skip ahead to 4(d) and come back
    to (c) later.
    <li>2019-04-12 10:40: 4(a) done. There were about a thousand
      different ways to do this one, but fortunately I was ready for
      that.  I don't know how much more will get done today, since I have
      to go get Megan from school this afternoon.
    <li>2019-04-11 22:35: 3(j), and question 3, done. My concentration
    is wavering, so I will pick up with question 4 tomorrow. I call
    the exam halfway graded.
    <li>2019-04-11 22:05: 3(i) done. Will attempt to get through (j)
    tonight, but that may be as far as I go for now.
    <li>2019-04-11 21:35: dinner eaten, (decaf) coffee drunk, daughter
    chatted with, and 3(h) done. There were a lot of ways you could do
    this part, and some of them found their way
    into <a href="final-20191.pdf">my solutions</a>.
    <li>2019-04-11 17:45: 3(g) done. Going home. 
    <li>2019-04-11 17:10: 3(f) done. It goes quicker when I sit down
    and do it. Funny, that.
    <li>2019-04-11 16:50: 3(e) done, via another walk down the hallway
    and a quick check to see if Arsenal are still winning (they were).
    <li>2019-04-11 16:00: 3(d), and page 4, done. It feels like slow progress
    today, but the exam is getting marked. I am also following the
    fortunes of Arsenal and Chelsea in the Europa League.
    <li>2019-04-11 15:35: 3(c) done. Of course, the walk down the
    hallway resulted in a chat with colleagues.
    <li>2019-04-11 14:50: 3(b) done. I need at least a walk down the hallway. 
    <li>2019-04-11 14:15: I am fuelled by lunch <em>and</em> tea. 3(a)
    done.
    <li>2019-04-11 13:15: 2(h) and thus page 3 done. I'm hungry.
    <li>2019-04-11 12:40: 2(g) done. Let me try for one more part
      before lunch.  The good thing about being in my office is that
      people pass by. The bad thing about being in my office is that
      people pass by.
    <li>2019-04-11 12:00: Back in my marking chair, with coffee. 2(f)
    done.
    <li>2019-04-10 23:05: 2(e) done. 9 parts out of 38 done. I am out
    of (mental) juice, though I could probably round up some (actual
    real) juice. That's it for tonight. I see I have some coding to
    start grading with tomorrow, which is a nice way to start. I
    suppose I had better tackle that kitchen now.
    <li>2019-04-10 22:25: 2(d) and page 2 of 11 done. My computer told
    me that I had to stand up and walk around, so I took the
    opportunity to start de-messing my kitchen. A long way to go there. I
    have dates (the fruit) to help me through the next stage of
    marking. The latest solutions are <a href="final-20191.pdf">here</a>.
    <li>2019-04-10 21:55: I'm back, and 2(c) is done. My kitchen is
    still a mess, but at least my fridge has food in it now. I picked
    up some snacks to help the marking along, but they may not all be
    healthy ones.
    <li>2019-04-10 20:15: 2(b) done; more fast work because most
    people got this right. I'm getting groceries now because (i) I
    don't mind going late tonight and (ii) this will give me a chance
    to work all day tomorrow without interruptions apart from my own
    procrastination.
    <li>2019-04-10 19:55: dinner eaten and 2(a) sped
    through. Crowdmark tells me I went through the entire (virtual)
    pile of 2(a)'s in 8 minutes "at 392 exams per hour".

      <p> I have to get groceries at some point tonight also.
    <li>2019-04-10 19:10: question 1 done, and, by happy coincidence,
    my dinner is ready.
    <li>2019-04-10 18:50: dinner is under way and won't need attention
    until it is ready to eat. On we go. (My kitchen is a mess, but I
    will ignore that until (much) later.)
    <li>2019-04-10 18:20: 1(c) marked. Back in the land of the living;
    amazing how things go faster when you're awake! The next thing I'm
    going to need is dinner, but I think I have something that can
    cook while I continue to grade.
    <li>2019-04-10 15:15: 1(b) marked. Progress is feeling rather slow.
    <li>2019-04-10 14:15: 1(a) marked. I may need a nap soon. I don't
      care for early mornings. My (evolving as I mark) solutions
      are <a href="final-20191.pdf">here</a>. The Figures
      are <a href="final-20191-f.pdf">here</a>, if you forgot to take
      yours with you. At the end, I will be returning your marked
      final exam to you by email, so you don't have to pay
      however-much-it-is to get a look at it.
    <li>2019-04-10 13:10: the exams have been scanned, and I now get
    to start grading (online). There may have to be tea involved
    first.
    <li>2019-04-03 12:40: pre-exam office hours Monday 1:00-4:00 in my
    office. I may be around before and (a little) after that as well.
    <li>2019-04-03 12:40: last lecture today: the rest of time series
    and as much of the frequency table stuff as I feel inclined to
    do. (I want to get to the airlines example, which is Simpson's
    Paradox and an explanation thereof.)
    <li>2019-04-01 15:50: heading over to BV 498 shortly, in case
    anyone is there. (A couple of people were, so it was a worthwhile trip.)
    <li>2019-03-29 21:00: The current state of the final exam
    (complete, apart from editing) is: 6 questions with a total of 38
    parts worth a total of 91 points. Printed out with space for
    answers it makes 11 pages. I think this is, by the usual standards
    of final exams in this course, a short exam. Note: (i) I've been
    wrong about that before, so don't count on it, (ii) we had more
    stuff on the midterm this time than usual, so there is less to go
    on the final. As befits my questions on this course, one of the
    questions goes up to part (j).
    <li>2019-03-28 14:30: I've been working on your final exam. It
    currently has 5 questions with 34 parts altogether worth a total
    of 81 points, but I want to add one more question which will
    probably bring the points up near 100. (The questions, or at least
    some of them, are longer than the ones on the midterm because they
    came out with a lot of small parts.)
    <li>2019-03-28 13:45: I think the last two chapters
    of <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/">PASIAS</a> read
    properly now, and match up with how I currently do things.
    <li>2019-03-27 16:30: I
    think <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/project/164745">this link</a>
    will get you to the lecture code project, including today's
    lecture
    code. Also, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/d29-lecture-code/master/20190327.Rmd">here</a>
    is the R Markdown itself if you are running R Studio on your
    computer.
    <li>2019-03-27 11:05: My solutions to <a href="a7.pdf">assignment
    7</a>. We are now officially done with assignments!
    <li>2019-03-26 14:45: don't forget to work through the <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/oldexams.html">old final exams</a>. 
    <li>2019-03-26 14:35: as review of Principal Components (last week
    and this), Factor Analysis (this week) and frequency table
    analysis (next week), please work through chapters 25 and 26
    of <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/">PASIAS</a>. There
    may be typos and/or confusions in there. If you see any of those
    before I do, let me know. I also have some material on time
    series, which you will see at the end of this week's class and the
    start of next week's. I don't have practice problems on that, so
    the time series material <em>will not be on the final exam</em>.
    <li>2019-03-26 14:30: Our final exam is on <strong>Wednesday April
    10 at 9:00am in IC 220</strong>. I will have pre-exam office hours between
    the end of classes and the exam. I'm thinking the Monday before
    the exam. (The last day of classes is April 5; if you are doing a
    project, it is due that day at 11:59pm to my email.)
    <li>2019-03-21 21:00: I forgot to post my solutions to assignment 6. <a href="a6.pdf">Here</a>.
    <li>2019-03-20 12:30: <a href="a7.pdf">Assignment 7</a>, the last
    one, is up. (The draft version had the wrong due date, now
    corrected.)  I'll put up my solutions to assignment 6 after class
    today.
      <p> I also have some material on time series that I dusted off
      and modernized (a little). If we have time, I'll share that with
      you in the last week of classes, but it won't be on the exam
      because I don't have any practice questions on it. (It needs
      eventually to find its way into PASIAS, but it hasn't yet.) The
      material I'm skipping on multidimensional scaling is a little
      more than two hours, but I don't have a sense of how much more,
      so I'm not sure how time left and material left stack up yet.
	
    <li>2019-03-18 12:30: we have lecture code for
    Wednesday, <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/3935/join?access_code=f4%2BCD3RZZ32ylG1wbVwdE2mvfAR9eyP8YQXBKmkk">here</a>
    or <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/d29-lecture-code/master/20190320.Rmd">here</a>. I
    also corrected some errors in the <a href="slides-sw.pdf">lecture
    slides</a>. (I was trying to access a file that didn't exist.)
    Also, a draft <a href="a7.pdf">assignment 7</a>, the first hand-in
    question of which you can do now. (The material for the second is
    on the agenda for the first half of this week's lecture.)
    <li>2019-03-13 09:45: my <a href="a5.pdf">assignment 5
    solutions</a>. Also, assignment 6, on discriminant analysis, is up
    on Quercus.
    <li>2019-03-12 11:50: this week's lecture code is the notebook
    with tomorrow's date
    in <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/3935/project/164745">this
    project</a>, or
    equivalently <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/d29-lecture-code/master/20190313.Rmd">this</a>. I
    don't expect to get all the way through cluster analysis this
      week, so some of this is likely to get moved to next week.
      <p> A rough plan for the rest of the way:
	<ul>
	  <li>March 13: the rest of discriminant analysis and the
	  start of cluster analysis
	  <li>March 20: the rest of cluster analysis and possibly the
	  beginning of principal components.
	  <li>March 27: principal components and some of factor analysis
	  <li>April 3: the rest of factor analysis and frequency tables
	</ul>
	I feel as if I missed something, but that will do as a plan,
	skipping multidimensional scaling. I also have some material
	on time series that I might be able to bash into shape.
    <li>2019-03-12 11:45: I declare myself happy
    with <a href="a6.pdf">Assignment 6</a>, with its one very long
    question. You'll see the rest of this material in the first half
    of this week's lecture. A cluster analysis question will appear on
    Assignment 7, which is likely to be the last one. The rest of the
    way, I will direct you to problems in PASIAS to work
    through. (There are normally eight assignments in this course, but
    we missed a week due to snow.)
    <li>2019-03-08 12:15: on the agenda for next week: the second half
    of discriminant analysis, and at least part of cluster
    analysis. Part of the code
    behind <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/slides-sw.pdf">my
    lecture slides</a> wasn't drawing the pretty pictures on slides
    410-413, but that is fixed now. (Check your copy and download a
    new one if needed.)
    <li>2019-03-08 12:00: I forgot to share this week's lecture
    code, <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/3935/join?access_code=f4%2BCD3RZZ32ylG1wbVwdE2mvfAR9eyP8YQXBKmkk">here</a>
    on R Studio Cloud
    or <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/d29-lecture-code/master/20190306.Rmd">here</a>
    for the notebook itself.
    <li>2019-03-07 16:30: I have a draft Assignment 6, which has one
    very long question on discriminant analysis. I'm expecting to
    start cluster analysis next week, but there won't be an assignment
    question on that until Assignment 7. I realize I am running out of
    weeks for assignments, but there will be a "fractional assignment"
      or two at the end, basically telling you to work through PASIAS.

      <p>We only have four more weeks of lectures! (How did that
      happen?) I'm thinking I'll skip Multidimensional Scaling because
      I want to do justice to cluster analysis and the principal
      components-factor analysis stuff. The frequency table analysis
      is quick, and I think quite interesting and useful, but it is
      covered in C51 in much more detail, so I might skip that too. (I
      like to end with that, because I think it's a nice cool-down
      from the rest of the course, but we'll see.)

      
    <li>2019-03-06 16:15: I am obviously dopey today. I realized that
    I wasn't intending to complete discriminant analysis today. We can
    take up to another hour on that, so we can look at
    cross-validation and the other two examples after all. My plan is
    for assignment 6 to have just one question on this stuff, since I
    have given you a long assignment 5. Next week, we can also start
    cluster analysis, time permitting.
    <li>2019-03-06 12:45: assignment 5 is up. It's a long one (three
    questions), but I warned you that it might be. Some stuff from
    last week's class and the first half of this week's.
    <li>2019-03-06 12:00: midterm stats: Q1 51.5 (64%), median 61
    (75%), Q3 69 (85%). These are about in line with what I'd expect
    in this course. Now I need to get ready for class!
    <li>2019-03-06 10:50: when you see your exam, read it through
    with <a href="midterm-20191.pdf">my solutions</a>. Note that two
    of the question parts changed marks (one from 2 to 3 and the other
    from 3 to 2 marks). If you have questions about any of the grading
    after that, email me with specifics of which question(s) you are
    curious about. I don't need the actual exam because I have access
    to that. (Coloured rectangles around answers mean that they are
    wrong; coloured rectangles around bits of the question indicate
    something missing. If I were doing this by hand, I would circle
    these.)
    <li>2019-03-06 10:44: the grades are up on Quercus. There were a
    few in the high 70s (out of 81), which is really nice work. Next,
    I will email everyone a link that you should be able to use to
    access your exam to look at it. (If you see a request for a
    username and password, wait a moment until you see something like
    "log in with Quercus", and then use your UTorID and password. I
    don't know how this will look for you, since this is my first
    time.)
    <li>2019-03-06 10:40: Gosh, I'm done marking. Now I know I can get
    the grades <em>and</em> the graded papers to you; I just have to
    figure out how.
    <li>2019-03-06 10:20: In the office earlier than expected. 6(d)
    done. I have a meeting at 11; if we are lucky, I can get 6(e) done
    before it.
    <li>2019-03-05 23:45: I had a very pleasant evening but no
    grading. Two parts to go, maybe about an hour's work, which I
    might have time to squeeze in tomorrow. But I want to make sure I
    am sufficiently organized for our lecture, and do things like
    getting assignment 5 up.
    <li>2019-03-05 15:20: 6(c) done (a fast one).
    <li>2019-03-05 15:00: 6(b) done (now out of 2 rather than 3). One
    more before I go home.
    <li>2019-03-05 14:30: 6(a) and page 8 done. On to the last page.
    <li>2019-03-05 14:05: 5(f) done. Tea required, then on to the last
    question.
    <li>2019-03-05 13:15: 5(e) done. I had a visitor in the
    meanwhile. Lunchtime.
    <li>2019-03-05 12:10: 5(d) and page 7 done. You guys made me work
    a bit harder on this one.
    <li>2019-03-05 11:20: 5(c) done, a mostly fast one.
    <li>2019-03-05 10:55: back in the saddle. 5(b) done.
    <li>2019-03-04 22:20: 5(a), and me for tonight, are done. My
    remaining task for the night is to fold laundry, about the only thing
    that is less exciting than marking exams!
    <li>2019-03-04 21:45: 4(g), and page 6, is done. Two-thirds of the
    way through. Looking ahead, I won't have as much time tomorrow (I
    have an R event in the evening!), so it seems unlikely that I'll
    finish tomorrow. I won't have much time on Wednesday, so we are
    currently looking at grades around lunchtime on Thursday.
    <li>2019-03-04 21:05: 4(f) is done. One more part to finish page 6.
    <li>2019-03-04 20:35: a reminder
    that <a href="midterm-20191.pdf">my solutions</a>, evolving as I
    mark, and the <a href="midterm-20191-f.pdf">code and output</a>,
    are available.
    <li>2019-03-04 20:35: 4(e) done. I have dinner in me and a hot
    drink beside me, so I hope I am good now.
    <li>2019-03-04 19:30: 4(d) done. This one is now out of 3, not 2.
      I ate salad, but am still hungry,
    which I am about to fix.
    <li>2019-03-04 17:30: 4(c) done. Heading home for dinner.
    <li>2019-03-04 16:55: 4(b) done. A quicker one. This is so far
    an easy exam to grade by my standards. I wonder what I have coming
    up?
    <li>2019-03-04 16:30: 4(a) done. (I took a bit of a break.)
    <li>2019-03-04 15:00: question 3 done. I have completed 4.5 of 9
    pages and 3 of 6 questions, so I declare myself halfway done.
    <li>2019-03-04 13:55: 3(e) done. A bit more thought required. I
    should have an Accessability paper to deal with, which will take a
    moment.
    <li>2019-03-04 13:05: 3(d) done. Faster than I thought. Lunchtime.
    <li>2019-03-04 12:20: 3(c) done. I knew that would be a fast
    one. 3(d), not so much, I suspect.
    <li>2019-03-04 12:05: 3(b) done. I can't help feeling I'm doing
    all the easy ones first, and the grading is about to get a whole
    lot more difficult.
    <li>2019-03-04 11:40: back to work. 3(a) done. I have a T-card
    (left at the exam) with student number ending in 1296. If you want
      it back, get it from me.
      <p> In case you are wondering, Crowdmark presents the exams to
      me in the order of the codes on the question paper. I don't want
      the same people at the top of the "pile" every time, so I pick a
      random exam to start at, and it loops around until I am done.
    <li>2019-03-03 22:05: Talking of tomorrow: <em>no tutorial</em>
    again. I'll be in my office (marking exams!) if you need to track
    me down.
    <li>2019-03-03 22:00: 2(g) done. Twelve minutes. One-third
    done. That'll do for tonight. Back to work tomorrow.
    <li>2019-03-03 21:35: 2(f) done. That was a slow one, because I
    had to work out what some of you were trying to do (and why it
    wouldn't work). Crowdmark tells me I took 49 minutes "at 66 exams
    per hour", the slowest one so far. (The fastest one is 2(c), which
    took me all of 9 minutes to go through all the exams.)
    <li>2019-03-03 20:30: dinner eaten, and 2(e) done. I haven't
    needed musical support yet, perhaps because it's not as huge a
    pile of exams as we had in C32.
    <li>2019-03-03 18:50: 2(d) done. I definitely need dinner
    now. (One nice thing about marking this way is that I don't have
    to stop to add the pages.)
    <li>2019-03-03 18:05: back from walk, and 2(c) done (fast). I may
    need dinner soon.
    <li>2019-03-03 16:50: 2(b) done. Going for a short walk before it
    gets dark.
    <li>2019-03-03 16:05: 2(a) done. Moving fast.
    <li>2019-03-03 15:25: 1(c) done. This took me a fair bit longer
    since there was more judgement involved on my part (and I used a
    lot more different comments). I've also eaten lunch.
    <li>2019-03-03 14:00: 1(b) done, and I still haven't eaten lunch
    yet. Must fix that.
    <li>2019-03-03 13:15: and so we begin. It looks as if Crowdmark
    grading will be pretty fast. I like how I don't have to write the
    same thing over and over (or handle all that paper), but I'm still
    getting the hang of the interface. 1(a) done. I need lunch. By the
    way,
    the <a href="https://www.flashscore.ca/game/O650AfjI/#game-summary">Wolfpack
    came from behind to win</a>, so I'm in a good mood.
    <li>2019-03-02 12:00: though it is snowing, campus is open and our
    midterm goes ahead. Allow extra time to get to campus.
    <li>2019-02-28 13:55: I am in my office now until 4:00pm if you
    have questions about midterm stuff.
    <li>2019-02-28 13:45: next week's lecture code
    is <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/d29-lecture-code/master/20190306.Rmd">here</a>
    and on rstudio.cloud. I don't imagine you care much about this
    yet. (I'm trying to get ahead of the game so that when I have
    midterms to grade, I can spend some time grading them.)
    <li>2019-02-27 16:40: today's lecture code is
    on <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/3935/project/164745">R
    Studio Cloud</a>
    or <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/d29-lecture-code/master/20190227.Rmd">here</a>.
    <li>2019-02-27 16:15: my <a href="a4.pdf">solutions to assignment
	4</a>, and my <a href="a5.pdf">draft assignment 5</a>. The
	assignment 4 material is on the midterm; the assignment 5
	stuff <em>is not</em>. I didn't get all the way through
	repeated measures today, but assignment 5 is not due until
	March 12, so I will probably leave question 6 there with the
	anticipation that we will complete the material for it
	next week. (Suggestion: don't worry about assignment 5 at all
	until after the midterm.)
    <li>2019-02-27 12:10: according to the campus status page, "we are
    monitoring conditions and will provide an update at 2 p.m. today."
    Just in time to cancel class part way through, I bet.
    <li>2019-02-27 12:00: reminder: midterm is Saturday March 2 at
    5:00pm in MW 170.
    <li>2019-02-27 10:15: The weather looks awful, but I am here, and
    campus is open, so class (as things currently stand) goes ahead.
    <li>2019-02-25 10:45: I will have the usual office hours plus
    tutorial this week, plus also pre-exam office hours on Thursday
    2:00-4:00 in my office. If you are done the assignment, the
    tutorial would be a good chance to get some of your questions
    about the midterm answered.
    <li>2019-02-21 16:45: after much shuffling about and recompiling
    of exams, we have an <a href="oldexams.html">old exams
    page</a>. These are all the relevant old exams I have. If any of
    the links don't work, or if they link to the wrong exam, let me
    know.

      <p>The best way to use these is to sit yourself down with a pen
    and all the stuff you would bring to the real exam, and <em>do an
    old exam under exam conditions</em>. When you have done
    it, <em>then</em> look at the solutions and grade yourself. What
    are you missing, and what do you need to go back and study again?
    There is no substitute for practice, which is why I give you
    assignments after every class. Reading through my solutions is a
    poor second-best, because answering questions, that you have not
    seen before, yourself is the way to see whether you know the
    stuff. (What you are after is a way of solving the questions that
    works <em>now</em>; code has changed a bit over the years, but the
    ideas have not (much). Ask if in doubt.)
    <li>2019-02-21 16:15: I have a folder of old exams, which I will
    update and share with you shortly. 
    <li>2019-02-21 16:00: The midterm is ready to roll. I spread the
    six questions out onto nine pages to give you room to
    write. Questions in this course seem to come out with a lot of
    parts. There are 34 parts altogether on this exam, mostly worth
    two or three points each, in my usual style.
    <li>2019-02-21 13:15: I am working on the midterm now. I think I
    am good with the current six questions worth 81 points (up to and
    including last week's lecture). The questions are currently
    arranged on six pages, but I am going to space them out a bit to
      give you more room to write.

      <p> I am trying out a system
      called <a href="https://crowdmark.com/">Crowdmark</a>. There is
      some work ahead of time to get the exam formatted correctly, but
      when I get the completed exams back, I scan them and then mark
      them online. At the end of the process, you get the marked exam
      back by email with my comments. If it all works. The advantage for me is
      that I am not handling paper or adding anything up, so the
      process should go faster and be better for you (eg. I can re-use
      my comments so I don't have to write them for each exam).
    <li>2019-02-17 09:45: I messed up questions 1 and 3 on the current
    assignment: the practice problems are from chapter <em>19</em> of
    PASIAS. If you re-download the question file, you should find that
    it is correct now. Sorry for confusion.
    <li>2019-02-13 17:00: I am hoping that I have found a way of
    sychronizing my lecture
    code <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/d29-lecture-code/master/20190213.Rmd">on
    Github</a>, so that I don't have to keep downloading it.
    <li>2019-02-13 13:00: <a href="a4.pdf">Assignment 4</a>, on
    today's stuff, is up on Quercus. It is due on February 26,
    since <em>next week is reading week</em>. As I look out of my
    office window, there is a hint of brightness and it's
    even <em>stopped snowing</em>.
    <li>2019-02-13 11:30: I am here, the weather is not so awful, and
    class is on. This week we follow <a href="20190213.Rmd">this R
    Notebook</a>, which might be on R on my computer since R Studio
    Cloud is looking rather slow today.
    <li>2019-02-11 11:30: I am having a very quiet office hour, and
    since there is no assignment due this week, on account of class
    being cancelled last week, I will <em>cancel</em> the tutorial
      today. If you want to find me, I'll be in my office until 5.

      <p> On the schedule for this week is exactly what we missed out
      on last week: analysis of variance, including two-way analysis,
      interactions and contrasts. Assignment 4, on this stuff, will be
      due after reading week (which is next week, so the assignment
	will be due something like the 26th).

	<p>There will be one more class before the midterm, on the
      27th. The material in that class <em>will not</em> be on the
      midterm. That means that this material <em>certainly will
      be</em> on the final, so you will need to know it at some
	  point.

	  <p>There will be no assignment due on March 5 (too soon
      after the midterm), but the material from February 27 will be on
      the assignment due March 12, which might thus be longer. It
      looks as if we'll have 7 assignments altogether rather than the
      usual 8; you get a break now rather than at the end of the
      semester. In summary: assignment 4 due on Feb 26, 5 on March 13,
      6 on March 20, 7 on March 27. I may have a short assignment 8
      due the last day of classes, depending on when the final exam
      is. Not because I want to be nasty, but because I want you to
      get practice with as much as possible, so that you can write a
      good final exam.

	<p>Having missed a week probably means that I won't get as far
      in this course as I would do otherwise, and I will have to make
      some selections of things to skip later on.
    <li>2019-02-08 15:30: I forgot to announce that the midterm
    is <em>Saturday March 2 5:00-7:00 pm</em>. Yes, Saturday night, I
    know. This is really late for a midterm, but so it is.
    <li>2019-02-06 13:00: my <a href="a3.pdf">assignment 3
    solutions</a>. Normally, this would be coupled with a posting of
    assignment 4, but there won't be an assignment 4 until next week.
    <li>2019-02-06 11:00: you are probably seeing a big red banner
    across the top of this page, but in case not, there is <em>no
    lecture</em> today because of the weather. This also means <em>no
    assignment</em> this week (you may cheer now). The stuff I was
    planning to talk about this week, on analysis of variance, will be
    deferred to next week, and assignment 4 will go up next week and
    be due later, probably after reading week.
    <li>2019-02-05
    12:20: <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/3935/join?access_code=f4%2BCD3RZZ32ylG1wbVwdE2mvfAR9eyP8YQXBKmkk">lecture
    code</a> for tomorrow's class. (This might take you into the
    "space", from which you need to navigate to the D29 notes project
    and then find the notebook with tomorrow's date on it.)
    Or, <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/3935/project/164745">try
    this</a> and see whether it works.  Or, if you prefer,
    the <a href="20190206.Rmd">R Markdown</a> in its current state.
    <li>2019-02-05 12:15: preview of <a href="a4.pdf">assignment
    4</a>, which will be doable after this week's class. There are two
    things on the agenda for this week: two-factor ANOVA (with, as
    subtopics, interactions and simple effects), and contrasts in
    ANOVA. The lecture notes (and code, which I will post in a moment)
    contain a review ANOVA example, which I don't think I need to
    spend much time on.
    <li>2019-01-31 21:15: I've been working on stuff for next week,
    when we will be revisiting analysis of variance: two-way ANOVA,
    simple effects, contrasts and the like. I reorganized the problems
    in chapter 18 of PASIAS to reflect the order of things in the
    lecture notes. Assignment 4 is almost ready to go: I will put up a
    preview of that later, maybe Monday.
    <li>2019-01-30 13:15: my solutions to <a href="a2.pdf">assignment
      2</a>; <a href="a3.pdf">assignment 3</a> is up on Quercus.
    <li>2019-01-29 13:00: A few edits to <a href="a3.pdf">assignment
    3</a>. I simplified one of the parts of question 4: not much
    shorter, but a good bit less thinking required. Also, R code for
    tomorrow's lecture is
    up <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/3935/project/164745">here</a>
    or <a href="20190130.Rmd">here</a>. (Addendum: both updated after class on 30th.)
    <li>2019-01-28 21:30: here is the current state
    of <a href="a3.pdf">assignment 3</a>. Yes, it is long, especially
    question 4. Partly this is to give you practice with basically
    everything you might meet in a survival analysis question.
    <li>2019-01-28 14:45: classes are cancelled from 5:00pm today,
    which means that our tutorial goes ahead.
    <li>2019-01-27 21:00: I've been working on assignment 3, the
    preview version of which will go up tomorrow. There's a question
    on survival analysis (the subject of this week's class) that you
    might consider unreasonably long. I may, or may not, edit it down.
    <li>2019-01-23 10:45: <a href="a1.pdf">My solutions to assignment
    1</a>. Also, <a href="a2.pdf">Assignment 2</a> up on Quercus.
    <li>2019-01-22 14:00: my R code for tomorrow's lecture is on R
    Studio
    Cloud <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/3935/join?access_code=f4%2BCD3RZZ32ylG1wbVwdE2mvfAR9eyP8YQXBKmkk">here</a>,
    named with tomorrow's date under STAD29, or the R Markdown file itself
    is <a href="20190123.Rmd">here (updated after class).</a>
    <li>2019-01-21 15:30: here is <a href="a2.pdf">Assignment
    2</a>. If you want to get started, questions 1 and 2 are doable
    now; questions 3 and 4 will make more sense after Wednesday's
    class.
    <li>2019-01-14 14:00: we have an <a href="a1.pdf">Assignment
    1</a>, which will be due Tuesday of <em>next</em> week. Questions
    1 and 2 are doable now; questions 3 and 4 will make sense after
    this week's lecture. Assignment is
    now <a href="https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/77890/assignments">up
    on Quercus</a>; let me know if you don't see it.
    <li>2019-01-11 15:00: update: proofreading chapter 16 (logistic
    regression) of PASIAS in preparation for next week; working on
    Assignment 1 which will go out next week. We have the BV 498
    computer lab Mondays 4-5pm starting next week. There is no
    assignment due next week, but if you have questions
    on <a href="a0.pdf">Assignment 0</a> or anything else, then or
    office hours would be a good time to find me to ask them.
    <li>2019-01-09 17:00: <a href="20190109.Rmd">R Notebook</a> of
    today's lecture code.
    <li>2019-01-09 13:20: <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/3935/join?access_code=f4%2BCD3RZZ32ylG1wbVwdE2mvfAR9eyP8YQXBKmkk">This link</a> should get you to a "shared space" in R Studio Cloud with the STAD29 lecture code in it. You'll need an R Studio Cloud username and password first. I will also put a link to the R Notebook here after class.

    after today's class. Nothing to hand in.
