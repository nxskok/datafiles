<h1>Links to SAS documentation</h1>

Back in the day, serious SAS users had a shelf-ful of intimidatingly
thick books about SAS. These books still exist, but you can get them
for free as PDFs these days. Here are some of the most useful
ones. They are as thick as they ever were, but you can use the tables
of contents to zero on in what you're looking for.

<li><a href="http://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/91pdf/sasdoc_913/base_proc_8977.pdf">Base
    SAS procedures guide</a>: the simpler data-management procedures,
    like <tt>proc univariate</tt>, are in here.
<li><a href="http://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/91pdf/sasdoc_913/base_lrdictionary_10307.pdf">SAS

    can do in data steps.
