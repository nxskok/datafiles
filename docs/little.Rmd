Inventing some data
===================

this is a *subheading*
------------------------


Let's invent some data (using `set.seed` so that the result is reproducible):

```{r}
set.seed(457299)
x=rnorm(50)
```

What kind of distribution does `x` actually have?

```{r}
summary(x)
```

or a boxplot:

```{r}
boxplot(x)
```


Since `x` actually came from a normal distribution, it should be at least approximately normal:

```{r}
qqnorm(x)
qqline(x)
```

The upper tail of this distribution happens to be too short.

A random literature review
==========================

@jien15 has nothing to do with this work. The original paper on the $t$ distribution is @student1908probable. Thunder is here: @huryn2015evaluation.
