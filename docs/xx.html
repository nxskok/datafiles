=========================================

Jan 28: I'm working on getting the class SAS examples up in some
useful format. Right now, they are pdfs containing the data, code and
complete output that the code produced. I believe you'll be able to
copy from your PDF-reader straight into SAS; let me know if not.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
Jan 25 lunchtime: people have been asking about copying and pasting a
SAS graph into a word doc. Marta hit upon the idea of using "Print
Screen", which probably works just fine. I also found this by
googling, and it works for me:

<ul>
<li> In the SAS graph window, select Edit and Copy (even though
  nothing is selected). Wait. Eventually SAS will report that the
  graph was copied to the clipboard.
<li> Go to Word, and to the place where you want the plot to
  appear. Select Edit and Paste Special. One of the options for what
  the thing is you're trying to paste should be Device-Independent
  Bitmap. Select that, and then OK. (Strictly, this worked for me in
  WordPad, since I don't have Word.)

</ul>

Anything that ends up with a printed copy of the graph in the
assignment is fine by me.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 

I also found out how you can select just some of the output
window. Click on where you'd like to start copying. Select Edit, and
Select (if you see what I mean). Click on the end of where you want to
copy. The whole thing should get highlighted. Then select Edit and
Copy, and paste as normal.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
Jan 25: I'm hoping that
everybody is able to connect to Mathlab to do assignment 1, which is
due tomorrow. Let me know if otherwise. I will soon be putting up
assignment 2, and (once I have all the assignment 1's) my solutions to
assignment 1.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Jan 19 again: I've put a link to the <a href="sas.html">SAS
      documentation</a> over on the left. These are <em>big</em> .pdf
files, but you can download them over a sufficiently fast connection
and refer to them as you need.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Jan 19: A couple of small things: the link to the SAS website was
broken, but is now fixed. Also,
the <a href="assignments.html">assignments page</a> doesn't seem to
display properly (or at all) in Internet Explorer, but it looks just
fine in Firefox (which is what I tested it on).

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Jan 17: Assignment 1 is up. Feel free to have a crack at question 1
now; the rest of it won't make much sense until after this week's
lecture. (A link to the assignment(s) is over on the left.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Jan 14: the <a href="drp.dat">DRP</a> data is up.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Jan 13: I am told that everyone should now have access to Mathlab to
get at SAS. Your username should be your UTSCid, with the
corresponding password. (The folks in charge of Mathlab get a daily
download of folks registered in each course, including grad courses.)

<p>On the subject of SAS: the <a href="http://support.sas.com">SAS website</a>
has lots of stuff, but it's not very easy to find (not in my opinion,
anyway). I recommend typing something like <tt>proc
      means sas</tt> into <a href="www.google.com">Google</a>. The
first few hits are often from the SAS website, and others might be
from courses that use SAS (also useful).

<p>I reckon I am happy with how the
current <a href="slides.handout.pdf">lecture notes</a> are now looking for
Regression (the subject of next week's class. So I don't expect any
more changes there. In due course (with luck tomorrow) I'll put up the
Degree of Reading Power data if you want to have a play with it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Jan 12: first class is <em>today</em> at 2:00pm in room S 221 (that is
on the Scarborough campus, and not at UTM, in case there is any
confusion). In any case, I am at UTSC now, and in today's weather I'm
not travelling to UTM!

<p> I keep discovering new things about SAS, and am trying to change
  the lecture notes accordingly. Next week's lecture notes, in
  particular, might be a bit different from the ones you downloaded
  last week (if you did).

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Jan 10 again: I took out the old computing page and subsumed the
relevant bits of it into the new <a href="sas.pdf">Introduction to
      SAS</a>. This will probably cause some of the lecture notes to
be wrong (or at least misleading), but we can fix that as we go.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Jan 10: I've been writing a <a href="sas.pdf">new handout</a> about
SAS as we will see it. If you have a chance, look through it before
class on Wednesday. I now have to look through the old computing page
and see whether it is worth keeping there or not.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Jan 5: The <a href="slides.handout.pdf">lecture notes</a> are
done. The idea is that each numbered chapter is one week's worth of
lecture, more or less. (Some of the chapters are short so we might get
two of them done in a week.) These notes are designed for you to print
out and scribble on during class. In week 1 (next week) I am planning
to talk a bit about the course outline (which is also on the front of
the lecture notes), and then move into the section on Inference (which
is meant to be a review). 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
I may add or subtract sections of the notes as we go through
(depending on what we decide to cover), so you may not want to go too
far ahead printing them out. But I'd like to talk about Inference in
week 1 and regression in week 2.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Jan 3: Here is the currently barely functional course web site. The
links to the left for the course outline and the computing
preliminaries both work. I have to do a little more work on the
lecture notes, and then there will be a link to them as well. In due
course, assignments, data sets and so on will find their way here too.
