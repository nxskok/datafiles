<h1>Links to R stuff</h1>

There is a <strong>lot</strong> of R material available in books and
on the web, because it has a large community of users who want to
share what they have found. I've tried to list things in the order
that you might need them.

<ul>
<li> <a href="r-project.org">The R-project web site</a> has a lot of
  stuff, including information on downloading and installing R, how to
  use it, and how to get hold of add-on stuff. Some highlights are
  below.
<li> R is kept on "mirrors" around the world, so that you can always
  download stuff from one near you. In Toronto, our local mirror
  is <a href="http://probability.ca/cran/">Jeff Rosenthal's</a>. Here,
  you can download R itself and add-on packages. R exists for Windows,
  Mac and Linux.
<li> <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">Download
    page for R Studio</a>. The top link, "Recommended For Your
    System", is probably the one you need. Check out (if you wish) the
    other links on the blue background at the top of the page.
<li> <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf">An
    Introduction to R</a> gives an introduction to the language and
    how to use it.
<li> <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html">Frequently asked
    questions</a>. 
<li> <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809164.do">R
    Cookbook</a> (also available on Amazon).
<li> <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449303228">25 Recipes
    for Getting Started with R (ditto)</a>.
<li> <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS4/">Modern Applied
    Statistics with S</a>. If you want detail, this is where to find
    it.
<li> There are <strong>lots</strong> of tutorials in aspects of R
  available on the web. Entering "R tutorial" into your favourite
  search engine will find all kinds of things.
<li> <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-data.pdf">R
    Data Import/Export</a> describes how you can read data from other
    places into R. In our course, we'll concentrate on reading from
    spreadsheets and text files, since that is what we need most often.
