First, we need to load the `tidyverse`:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then we need to find our data file:

```{r}
f=file.choose()
f
```

Now we can read in and display the data.

```{r}
mydata=read_csv(f)
mydata
```

There are correctly six integer (whole-number) values of `x`. Some summaries follow. First the mean and SD:

```{r}
mydata %>% 
  summarize(xmean=mean(x), xsd=sd(x))
```

The mean is 17 and the SD is about 7.35.

Next, a boxplot:

```{r}
ggplot(mydata,aes(x=1,y=x))+geom_boxplot()
```

This has a long upper whisker, showing a long right tail (and thus a right skew).
